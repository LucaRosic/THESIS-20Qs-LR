      "Text: The WB Television Network (for Warner Bros., or the \"Frog Network\", for its former mascot, Michigan J. Frog) was an American television network launched on broadcast television on January 11, 1995, as a joint venture between the Warner Bros. Entertainment division of Time Warner and the Tribune Broadcasting subsidiary of the Tribune Company, with the former acting as controlling partner. The network aired programs targeting teenagers and young adults between 12 and 34, with its children's division, Kids' WB, geared toward children 6 to 12. On January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation and Warner Bros. Entertainment announced plans to merge its subsidiary networks, UPN and the WB, and launch The CW later that same year. The WB Television Network shut down on September 17, 2006, with some programs from both it and competitor UPN (which had shut down on September 15) moving to The CW when it launched the following day, September 18. Time Warner re-used the WB brand for an online network that launched on April 28, 2008. Until it was closed in December 2013, the website allowed users to watch shows aired on the former television network, as well as programming from the defunct In2TV service created prior to Time Warner's spinoff of AOL. The website could only be accessed within the United States..\n",

       "\"Van Helsing is a 2004 action gothic horror film written and directed by Stephen Sommers. It stars Hugh Jackman as Dutch monster hunter Van Helsing, and Kate Beckinsale as Anna Valerious. Van Helsing is both a homage and tribute to the Universal Horror Monster films from the 1930s and 1940s (also produced by Universal Pictures which were in turn partially based on novels by Bram Stoker and Mary Shelley), of which Sommers is a fan. The eponymous character was inspired by the Dutch vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing from Irish author Bram Stoker's novel Dracula. Distributed by Universal Pictures, the film includes a number of monsters such as Count Dracula (and other vampires), Frankenstein's monster, Duergar, Mr. Hyde and werewolves in a way similar to the multi-monster movies that Universal produced in the 1940s, such as Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, House of Frankenstein and House of Dracula. The film received mostly negative reviews but grossed $300 million worldwide against a budget of $160–170 million.\""
