0,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/David_Bowie,David Bowie,"David Robert Jones (8 January 1947 – 10 January 2016), known professionally as David Bowie (/ˈboʊi/ BOH-ee), was an English singer-songwriter and actor. A leading figure in the music industry, he is regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. Bowie was acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, and his music and stagecraft had a significant impact on popular music. Bowie developed an interest in music from an early age. He studied art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. ""Space Oddity"", released in 1969, was his first top-five entry on the UK Singles Chart. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with his flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of Bowie's single ""Starman"" and album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted towards a sound he characterised as ""plastic soul"", initially alienating many of his UK fans but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single ""Fame"" and the album Young Americans. In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film The Man Who Fell to Earth and released Station to Station. In 1977, he again changed direction with the electronic-inflected album Low, the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that came to be known as the ""Berlin Trilogy"". ""Heroes"" (1977) and Lodger (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise. After uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had three number-one hits: the 1980 single ""Ashes to Ashes"", its album Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), and ""Under Pressure"" (a 1981 collaboration with Queen). He achieved massive commercial success in the 1980s starting with Let's Dance (1983). Between 1988 and 1992, he fronted the hard rock band Tin Machine before resuming his solo career in 1993. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including industrial and jungle. He also continued acting; his roles included Major Jack Celliers in Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (1983), Jareth the Goblin King in Labyrinth (1986), Pontius Pilate in The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), and Nikola Tesla in The Prestige (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He stopped touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. In 2013, Bowie returned from a decade-long recording hiatus with The Next Day. He remained musically active until his death from liver cancer at his home in New York City. He died two days after both his 69th birthday and the release of his final album, Blackstar (2016). During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at over 100 million records worldwide, made him one of the best-selling musicians of all time. In the UK, he was awarded ten platinum, eleven gold and eight silver album certifications, and released 11 number-one albums. In the US, he received five platinum and nine gold certifications. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Rolling Stone ranked him among the greatest artists in history. As of 2022, Bowie was the best-selling vinyl artist of the 21st century.","[['was', 'English'], ['was acclaimed by', 'critics particularly for his innovative work during 1970s'], ['was acclaimed by',

1,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Kanye_West,Kanye West,"Ye (/jeɪ/ YAY; born Kanye Omari West /ˈkɑːnjeɪ/ KAHN-yay; June 8, 1977) is an American rapper, songwriter, record producer and fashion designer. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential hip hop artists and producers. Born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago, West initially gained recognition as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records in the early 2000s, producing singles for several artists and developing the ""chipmunk soul"" sampling style. Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, he released his debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004), to critical and commercial success. He founded the record label GOOD Music later that year. West explored diverse musical elements like orchestras, synthesizers, and autotune on the albums Late Registration (2005), Graduation (2007), and 808s & Heartbreak (2008). His fifth and sixth albums My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010) and Yeezus (2013) were also met with critical and commercial success. West further diversified his musical styles on The Life of Pablo (2016) and Ye (2018) and explored Christian and gospel music on Jesus Is King (2019). His tenth album Donda (2021) was released to continued commercial success but mixed critical reception. He released its sequel Donda 2 (2022) a few months later, exclusively through a tie-in audio speaker service. West's discography also includes the two full-length collaborative albums Watch the Throne (2011) with Jay-Z and Kids See Ghosts (2018) with Kid Cudi. One of the world's best-selling music artists, with over 160 million records sold, West has won 22 Grammy Awards and 75 nominations, the joint tenth-most of all time, and the joint-most Grammy awards of any rapper along with Jay-Z. Among his other awards are the Billboard Artist Achievement Award, a joint-record three Brit Awards for Best International Male Solo Artist and the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. Six of West's albums were included on Rolling Stone's 2020 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list with the same publication naming him one of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time. He holds the joint record (with Bob Dylan) for most albums (4) topping the annual Pazz & Jop critic poll, and has the 5th most appearances on the Billboard Hot 100 (133 entries). Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2005 and 2015. As a fashion designer, he has collaborated with Nike, Louis Vuitton, Gap, and A.P.C. on clothing and footwear and led the Yeezy collaboration with Adidas. He is also the founder and head of the creative content company Donda. Forbes estimated his net worth at $400 million as of 2022, making him among the wealthiest musicians in the world. West's outspoken views have received significant media coverage; he has been a frequent source of controversy due to his conduct on social media and at awards shows and public settings, as well as his comments on the music and fashion industries, U.S. politics, race, and slavery. His Christian faith, high-profile marriage to Kim Kardashian, and mental health have also been topics of media attention. In 2020, West launched an unsuccessful independent presidential campaign that primarily advocated for a consistent life ethic. In 2022, he was widely condemned and lost many sponsors and partnerships—including his collaborations with Adidas, Gap, and Balenciaga—after making a series of antisemitic statements. In November 2022, he announced his 2024 presidential campaign, appearing publicly with white supremacist Nick Fuentes. He later publicly praised Adolf Hitler, denied the Holocaust, and identified as a Nazi.","[['is', 'American'], ['is', 'regarded'], ['is', 'widely regarded'], ['gained recognition in', '2000s'],

2,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Eminem,Eminem,"Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known professionally as Eminem (/ˌɛmɪˈnɛm/; stylized as EMINƎM), is an American rapper and record producer. He is credited with popularizing hip hop in middle America and is critically acclaimed as one of the greatest rappers of all time. Eminem's global success and acclaimed works are widely regarded as having broken racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him widely controversial, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has been cited as an influence for many artists of various genres. After the release of his debut album Infinite (1996) and the extended play Slim Shady EP (1997), Eminem signed with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP. His next two releases, The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and The Eminem Show (2002), were worldwide successes and were both nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. After the release of his next album, Encore (2004), Eminem went on hiatus in 2005, largely due to a prescription drug addiction. He returned to the music industry four years later with the release of Relapse (2009) and Recovery was released the following year. Recovery was the best-selling album worldwide of 2010, making it Eminem's second album, after The Eminem Show in 2002, to be the best-selling album of the year worldwide. In the following years, he released the US number one albums The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013), Revival (2017), Kamikaze (2018) and Music to Be Murdered By (2020). Eminem made his debut in the film industry with the musical drama film 8 Mile (2002), playing a fictionalized version of himself, and his track ""Lose Yourself"" from its soundtrack won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, making him the first hip hop artist ever to win the award. Eminem has made cameo appearances in the films The Wash (2001), Funny People (2009) and The Interview (2014) and the television series Entourage (2010). He has also developed other ventures, including Shady Records, a joint venture with manager Paul Rosenberg, which helped launch the careers of artists such as 50 Cent, D12 and Obie Trice, among others. He has also established his own channel, Shade 45, on Sirius XM Radio. In addition to his solo career, Eminem was a member of the hip hop group D12. He is also known for collaborations with fellow Detroit-based rapper Royce da 5'9""; the two are collectively known as Bad Meets Evil. Eminem is among the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated worldwide sales of over 220 million records. He was the best-selling music artist in the United States of the 2000s and the best-selling male music artist in the United States of the 2010s, third overall. Billboard named him the ""Artist of the Decade (2000–2009)"". He has had ten number-one albums on the Billboard 200—which all consecutively debuted at number one on the chart, making him the first artist to achieve this—and five number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, Curtain Call: The Hits (2005), ""Lose Yourself"", ""Love the Way You Lie"" and ""Not Afraid"" have all been certified Diamond or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Rolling Stone has included him in its lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time. He has won numerous awards, including 15 Grammy Awards, eight American Music Awards, 17 Billboard Music Awards, an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award and an MTV Europe Music Global Icon Award. In November 2022, Eminem was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.","[['is credited with', 'hip hop'], ['is credited with', 'popularizing hip hop in America'], ['is credited with',

4,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/George_W._Bush,George W. Bush,"George Walker Bush (born July 6, 1946) is an American politician who served as the 43rd president of the United States from 2001 to 2009. A member of the Republican Party, Bush family, and son of the 41st president George H. W. Bush, he previously served as the 46th governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000. While in his twenties, Bush flew warplanes in the Texas Air National Guard. After graduating from Harvard Business School in 1975, he worked in the oil industry. In 1978, Bush unsuccessfully ran for the House of Representatives. He later co-owned the Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball before he was elected governor of Texas in 1994. As governor, Bush successfully sponsored legislation for tort reform, increased education funding, set higher standards for schools, and reformed the criminal justice system. He also helped make Texas the leading producer of wind powered electricity in the nation. In the 2000 presidential election, Bush defeated Democratic incumbent Vice President Al Gore after a narrow and contested win that involved a Supreme Court decision to stop a recount in Florida. Upon taking office, Bush signed a major tax cut program and education reform bill, the No Child Left Behind Act. He pushed for socially conservative efforts such as the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act and faith-based initiatives. A decisive event that reshaped his administration was the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, resulting in the start of the war on terror and the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. Bush ordered the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, to overthrow the Taliban, destroy al-Qaeda, and capture Osama bin Laden. He signed the Patriot Act to authorize surveillance of suspected terrorists. He also ordered the 2003 invasion of Iraq, on the belief that Saddam Hussein's regime possessed weapons of mass destruction; this led to Hussein's eventual overthrow and capture by U.S. forces. Bush also signed the Medicare Modernization Act, which created Medicare Part D. Bush was re-elected president in 2004, defeating Democrat John Kerry and winning the popular vote. During his second term, Bush reached multiple free trade agreements. He appointed John Roberts and Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court. He sought major changes to Social Security and immigration laws, but both efforts failed in Congress. Bush was widely criticized for his handling of Hurricane Katrina and the midterm dismissal of U.S. attorneys. In the midst of his unpopularity, the Democrats regained control of Congress in the 2006 elections. The Afghanistan and Iraq wars continued, and in January 2007, Bush launched a surge of troops in Iraq. By December, the U.S. entered the Great Recession, prompting the Bush administration to obtain congressional approval for multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country's financial system, including the Troubled Asset Relief Program. After finishing his second term, Bush returned to Texas, where his presidential library opened in 2013. At various points in his presidency, Bush was among both the most popular and unpopular presidents in U.S. history. He received the highest recorded approval ratings in the wake of the September 11 attacks, but also one of the lowest such ratings during the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Although public favorability of Bush has improved since he left office, his presidency has generally been rated as below-average by scholars.","[['is', 'American'], ['served as', 'governor of Texas'],

5,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Prince_(musician),Prince (musician),"Prince Rogers Nelson (June 7, 1958 – April 21, 2016), more commonly known mononymously as Prince, was an American singer-songwriter, musician, and record producer. The recipient of numerous awards and nominations, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest musicians of his generation. He was known for his flamboyant, androgynous persona; his wide vocal range, which included a far-reaching falsetto and high-pitched screams; and his skill as a multi-instrumentalist, often preferring to play all or most of the instruments on his recordings. Prince produced his albums himself, pioneering the Minneapolis sound. His music incorporated a wide variety of styles, including funk, R&B, rock, new wave, soul, synth-pop, pop, jazz, and hip hop. Born and raised in Minneapolis, Prince signed a record deal with Warner Bros. Records at the age of 19, soon releasing the albums For You (1978) and Prince (1979). He went on to achieve critical success with the influential albums Dirty Mind (1980), Controversy (1981), and 1999 (1982). His sixth album, Purple Rain (1984), was recorded with his new backing band the Revolution, and was also the soundtrack to the film of the same name in which he starred. Purple Rain garnered continued success for Prince and was a major commercial achievement, spending six consecutive months atop the Billboard 200 chart. The soundtrack also won Prince the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score. After disbanding the Revolution, Prince released the album Sign o' the Times (1987), widely hailed by critics as the greatest work of his career. In the midst of a contractual dispute with Warner Bros. in 1993, he changed his stage name to the unpronounceable symbol (known to fans as the ""Love Symbol"") and was often referred to as The Artist Formerly Known as Prince (or TAFKAP) or simply The Artist. After signing with Arista Records in 1998, Prince reverted to his original name in 2000. Over the next decade, six of his albums entered the U.S. top 10 charts. In April 2016, at the age of 57, Prince died after accidentally overdosing on fentanyl at his Paisley Park home and recording studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota. He was a prolific musician who released 39 albums during his life, with a vast array of unreleased material left in a custom-built bank vault underneath his home after his death, including fully completed albums and over 50 finished music videos. He also released songs under multiple pseudonyms during his life, as well as writing songs that were made popular after being covered by other musicians, most notably ""Nothing Compares 2 U"" by Sinéad O'Connor and ""Manic Monday"" by the Bangles. Estimates of the complete number of songs written by Prince range anywhere from 500 to well over 1,000. Released posthumously, his demo albums Piano and a Microphone 1983 (2018) and Originals (2019) both received critical acclaim. Prince sold over 100 million records worldwide, ranking him among the best-selling music artists of all time. His awards included the Grammy President's Merit Award, the American Music Awards for Achievement and of Merit, the Billboard Icon Award, an Academy Award, and a Golden Globe Award. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006, and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2016, and was inducted twice into the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame in 2022.","[['was', 'singer songwriter'], ['was', 'American singer songwriter'], ['was', 'American'], ['was known for', 'his flamboyant persona'], ['was known for', 'his

6,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Justin_Bieber,Justin Bieber,"Justin Drew Bieber (/biːbər/ BEE-bər; born March 1, 1994) is a Canadian singer. Bieber is recognized for his genre-melding musicianship and has played an influential role in modern-day popular music. He was discovered by American record executive Scooter Braun and signed with RBMG Records in 2008, gaining recognition with the release of his debut seven-track EP My World (2009) and soon establishing himself as a teen idol. Bieber achieved commercial success with his teen pop-driven debut studio album, My World 2.0 (2010), which debuted atop the US Billboard 200, making him the youngest solo male act to top the chart in 47 years. The album spawned the internationally successful single ""Baby"", which became one of the highest certified singles of all time in the US. His second studio album, Under the Mistletoe (2011), became the first Christmas album by a male artist to debut at number one in the US. Bieber experimented with dance-pop in his third studio album, Believe (2012), and went on to become the first artist in history with five US number-one albums at age 18. Between 2013 and 2014, Bieber was involved in multiple controversies and legal issues, which had a drastic impact on his public image. In 2015, Bieber explored EDM with the release of ""Where Are Ü Now"", which won the Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Recording. The song's musical direction played an instrumental role in his fourth studio album, Purpose, which produced three US number-one singles: ""Love Yourself"", ""Sorry"", and ""What Do You Mean?"". He became the first artist in history to occupy the entire top three of the UK Singles Chart. Bieber diversified on numerous collaborations between 2016 and 2017, including ""I'm the One"" and his remix to ""Despacito"" — both reaching number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 a week apart, making him the first artist in history to chart new number-one songs in consecutive weeks. ""Despacito"" was named the greatest Latin song of all time by Billboard and earned Bieber his career-first Latin Grammy Award. In 2019, he released a country collaboration with Dan + Shay, ""10,000 Hours"", which won the Grammy Award for Best Country Duo/Group Performance. In 2020, Bieber released his R&B-led fifth studio album, Changes, which debuted at number one in both the UK and US, and a standalone duet with Ariana Grande, ""Stuck with U"", which debuted atop the US Billboard Hot 100. Bieber returned to his pop roots on his sixth studio album, Justice (2021). It produced the worldwide hit ""Peaches"" and debuted atop the US Billboard 200, making him the youngest soloist to have eight US number-one albums, a record held previously by Elvis Presley since 1965. The same year, Bieber released ""Stay"" with the Kid Laroi, which became his eighth US number-one single. Bieber is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 150 million records worldwide. He is credited with three Diamond certifications from the RIAA for ""Baby"", ""Sorry"" and ""Despacito"". He has received numerous accolades, including two Grammy Awards, one Latin Grammy Award, eight Juno Awards, two Brit Awards, one Bambi Award, 26 Billboard Music Awards, 18 American Music Awards, 22 MTV Europe Music Awards (the most wins for any artist), 23 Teen Choice Awards (the most wins for a male individual), and 33 Guinness World Records. Time named Bieber one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, and he was included on Forbes' list of the top ten most powerful celebrities in 2011, 2012, and 2013.","[['is',

Originally a stage actor, Kilmer found fame after appearances in comedy films, starting with Top Secret! (1984) and Real Genius (1985), as well as the military action film Top Gun (1986) and the fantasy film Willow (1988). Kilmer gained acclaim for his portrayal of Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone's The Doors (1991).

""If there is an award for the most unsung leading man of his generation, Kilmer should get it,"" wrote critic Roger Ebert, ""he has shown a range of characters so convincing that it's likely most people, even now, don't realize they were looking at the same actor."" Since 2015, Kilmer has privately struggled with throat cancer; he had a procedure on his trachea that damaged his vocal cords to the point where he had extreme difficulty speaking. He also underwent chemotherapy and two tracheotomies. In 2020, he published his memoir titled, I'm Your Huckleberry: A Memoir. His struggle was captured in the 2021 documentary titled Val which documented his career and health issues. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival to critical acclaim. In 2022, Kilmer reprised his role as Iceman, reuniting with Tom Cruise, in Top Gun: Maverick (2022). One of the best-paid actors of the 1990s, movies featuring Kilmer have grossed over $3.5 billion at the worldwide box-office.","[['is', 'American'], ['gained acclaim for', ""his portrayal of Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone 's Doors 1991""], ['gained acclaim for', 'his portrayal of Jim Morrison'], ['gained acclaim for', ""his portrayal in Oliver Stone 's Doors 1991""], ['gained acclaim for', 'his portrayal'], ['gained', 'acclaim'], ['was', 'as often cast as main character'], ['was often cast as', 'character in acclaimed films'], ['was', 'as often cast as character in films'], ['was', 'as often cast as main character in films'], ['was cast as', 'character in films'], ['was cast as', 'main character in films'], ['was cast as', 'main character in critically acclaimed films'], ['was', 'as cast as main character in films'], ['was cast as', 'character'], ['has', 'stardom'], ['was', 'as often cast as character'], ['was cast as', 'character in critically acclaimed films'], ['was', 'as cast as character'], ['was', 'as often cast'], ['was cast as', 'main character'], ['was', 'as often cast as main character in critically acclaimed films'], ['was often cast as', 'main character in critically acclaimed films'], ['was', 'as often cast as character in critically acclaimed films'], ['was', 'as often cast as character in acclaimed films'], ['was', 'as cast as main character in critically acclaimed films'], ['was', 'often cast'], ['was', 'as cast as character in films'], ['was cast as', 'character in acclaimed films'], ['was often cast as', 'main character'], ['was', 'as cast as main character in acclaimed films'], ['was often cast as', 'main character in films'], ['was', 'as cast as character in critically acclaimed films'], ['was often cast as', 'character in critically acclaimed films'], ['was', 'as cast as character in acclaimed films'], ['was cast as', 'main character in acclaimed films'], ['was often cast as', 'character'], ['was often cast as', 'main character in acclaimed films'], ['was', 'as often cast as main character in acclaimed films'], ['was', 'cast'], ['was', 'as cast'], ['was', 'as cast as main character'], ['was often cast as', 'character in films'], ['replaced', 'Michael Keaton'], ['continued', 'acting in films'], ['continued', 'acting'], ['acting in', 'films'], ['should get', 'it'], ['has struggled Since', '2015'], ['has privately struggled with', 'throat cancer'], ['had', 'procedure'], ['has struggled with', 'throat cancer'], ['has privately struggled Since', '2015'], ['underwent', 'chemotherapy'], ['also underwent', 'chemotherapy'], ['published In', '2020'], ['reprised', 'his role reuniting'], ['reprised', 'his role as Iceman'], ['reprised', 'his role as Iceman reuniting with Tom Cruise in Top Gun'], ['reprised', 'his role as Iceman reuniting with Tom Cruise'], ['reprised', 'his role reuniting with Tom Cruise'], ['reprised', 'his role as Iceman reuniting'], ['reprised', 'his role reuniting with Tom Cruise in Top Gun'], ['reprised', 'his role']]","[['excelledIn', 'his_portrayal'], ['appearedIn', 'Jim_Morrison'], ['appearedIn', ""Oliver_Stone_'s_Doors""], ['approvedOf', 'his_portrayal'], ['sonOf', 'Jim_Morrison'], ['wonFor', 'his_portrayal'], ['gained', 'acclaim'], ['appearedAs', 'main_character'], ['in', 'character'], ['appearedIn', 'acclaimed_films'], ['appearedIn', 'films'], ['appearedIn', 'main_character'], ['appearedIn', 'critically_acclaimed_films'], ['appearedAs', 'character'], ['has', 'stardom'], ['cast', 'cast'], ['as', 'cast'], ['replaced', 'Michael_Keaton'], ['strugglesWith', 'throat_cancer'], ['neverHad', 'procedure'], ['underwent', 'chemotherapy'], ['reprised', 'role'], ['reprisedAs', 'his_role'], ['returnedAs', 'Iceman'], ['returnedIn', 'his_role'], ['appearedIn', 'Iceman'], ['appearedIn', 'Tom_Cruise'], ['returnedIn', 'Top_Gun'], ['continuedWith', 'his_role'], ['returnedWith', 'Iceman'], ['reunitedWith', 'Tom_Cruise'], ['isReuniting', 'his_role'], ['reuniting', 'Iceman']]"

The ninth season, 1984, takes place outside Los Angeles during the 1980s and focuses the staff of a summer camp reopening after a massacre 14 years prior. The tenth season, the two-part Double Feature, focuses on a family in 2021 in Provincetown, Massachusetts, in its first part, Red Tide, where they meet the town's true inhabitants, and later, in its second half, Death Valley, a group of camping students who find themselves in a conspiracy involving the extraterrestrials of Asylum.

In January 2020, FX renewed the series for an additional three seasons, including the eleventh season, bringing it to at least thirteen confirmed seasons. Although reception to individual seasons has varied, American Horror Story largely has been well received by television critics, with the majority of the praise going towards the cast, particularly Jessica Lange, who won two Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performances. James Cromwell and Kathy Bates each won an Emmy Award for their performances, while Lady Gaga won a Golden Globe Award.

13,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Japan,Japan,"Japan (Japanese: 日本, Nippon or Nihon, and formally 日本国, Nihonkoku) is an island country in East Asia. It is situated in the northwest Pacific Ocean, and is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan, while extending from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north toward the East China Sea, Philippine Sea, and Taiwan in the south. Japan is a part of the Ring of Fire, and spans an archipelago of 6852 islands covering 377,975 square kilometers (145,937 sq mi); the five main islands are Hokkaido, Honshu (the ""mainland""), Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa. Tokyo is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Fukuoka, Kobe, and Kyoto. Japan is the eleventh most populous country in the world, as well as one of the most densely populated and urbanized. About three-fourths of the country's terrain is mountainous, concentrating its population of 123.2 million on narrow coastal plains. Japan is divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with more than 35.6 million residents. Japan has been inhabited since the Upper Paleolithic period (30,000 BC), though the first written mention of the archipelago appears in a Chinese chronicle (the Book of Han) finished in the 2nd century AD. Between the 4th and 9th centuries, the kingdoms of Japan became unified under an emperor and the imperial court based in Heian-kyō. Beginning in the 12th century, political power was held by a series of military dictators (shōgun) and feudal lords (daimyō) and enforced by a class of warrior nobility (samurai). After a century-long period of civil war, the country was reunified in 1603 under the Tokugawa shogunate, which enacted an isolationist foreign policy. In 1854, a United States fleet forced Japan to open trade to the West, which led to the end of the shogunate and the restoration of imperial power in 1868. In the Meiji period, the Empire of Japan adopted a Western-modeled constitution and pursued a program of industrialization and modernization. Amidst a rise in militarism and overseas colonization, Japan invaded China in 1937 and entered World War II as an Axis power in 1941. After suffering defeat in the Pacific War and two atomic bombings, Japan surrendered in 1945 and came under a seven-year Allied occupation, during which it adopted a new constitution and began a military alliance with the United States. Under the 1947 constitution, Japan has maintained a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a bicameral legislature, the National Diet. Japan is a developed country, member of OECD ,and a great power in global politics. Its economy is the world's third-largest by nominal GDP and the fourth-largest by PPP. Although Japan has renounced its right to declare war, the country maintains Self-Defense Forces that rank as one of the world's strongest militaries. After World War II, Japan experienced record growth in an economic miracle, becoming the second-largest economy in the world by 1972 but has stagnated since 1995 in what is referred to as the Lost Decades. Japan has the world's highest life expectancy, though it is experiencing a decline in population. A global leader in the automotive, robotics and electronics industries, the country has made significant contributions to science and technology. The culture of Japan is well known around the world, including its art, cuisine, film, music, and popular culture, which encompasses prominent comic, animation and video game industries. It is a member of numerous international organizations, including the United Nations (since 1956), G20 and Group of Seven.","[['is', 'island country'], ['is', 'island country in East Asia'], ['is

14,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Barack_Obama,Barack Obama,"Barack Hussein Obama II (/bəˈrɑːk huːˈseɪn oʊˈbɑːmə/ bə-RAHK hoo-SAYN oh-BAH-mə; born August 4, 1961) is an American politician who served as the 44th president of the United States from 2009 to 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, Obama was the first African-American president of the United States. He previously served as a U.S. senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and as an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004, and previously worked as a civil rights lawyer before entering politics. Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988, he enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. After graduating, he became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Turning to elective politics, he represented the 13th district in the Illinois Senate from 1997 until 2004, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004 with his March Senate primary win, his well-received July Democratic National Convention keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, he was nominated by the Democratic Party for president and chose Joe Biden as his running mate. Obama was elected over Republican nominee John McCain in the presidential election and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, he was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, a decision that drew a mixture of praise and criticism. Obama's first-term actions addressed the global financial crisis and included a major stimulus package, a partial extension of George W. Bush's tax cuts, legislation to reform health care, a major financial regulation reform bill, and the end of a major US military presence in Iraq. Obama also appointed Supreme Court Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, the latter of whom became the first Hispanic American on the Supreme Court. His policy against terrorism downplayed Bush's counterinsurgency model, expanding air strikes and making extensive use of special forces, and encouraging greater reliance on host-government militaries. He also ordered the counterterrorism raid that killed Osama bin Laden. After winning re-election by defeating Republican opponent Mitt Romney, Obama was sworn in for a second term on January 20, 2013. In his second term, Obama took steps to combat climate change, signing a major international climate agreement and an executive order to limit carbon emissions. Obama also presided over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and other legislation passed in his first term, and he negotiated a nuclear agreement with Iran and normalized relations with Cuba. The number of American soldiers in Afghanistan fell dramatically during Obama's second term, though U.S. soldiers remained in Afghanistan throughout Obama's presidency. Obama left office on January 20, 2017, and continues to reside in Washington, D.C. His presidential library in Chicago began construction in 2021. During Obama's terms as president, the United States' reputation abroad, as well as the American economy, significantly improved. Rankings by scholars and historians place him among the upper to mid tier of American presidents. Since leaving office, Obama has remained active in Democratic politics, including campaigning for candidates in various American elections. Outside of politics, Obama has published three bestselling books: Dreams from My Father (1995), The Audacity of Hope (2006) and A Promised Land (2020).","[['is', 'American'], ['was', 'president'],

15,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Bill_Clinton,Bill Clinton,"William Jefferson Clinton (né Blythe III; born August 19, 1946) is an American politician who served as the 42nd president of the United States from 1993 to 2001. He previously served as governor of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1992, and as attorney general of Arkansas from 1977 to 1979. A member of the Democratic Party, Clinton became known as a New Democrat, as many of his policies reflected a centrist ""Third Way"" political philosophy. He is the husband of Hillary Clinton, who was a senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 and the Democratic nominee for president in the 2016 presidential election. Clinton was born and raised in Arkansas and attended Georgetown University. He received a Rhodes Scholarship to study at University College, Oxford and later graduated from Yale Law School. He met Hillary Rodham at Yale; they married in 1975. After graduating from law school, Clinton returned to Arkansas and won election as state attorney general, followed by two non-consecutive tenures as Arkansas governor. As governor, he overhauled the state's education system and served as chairman of the National Governors Association. Clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential election, defeating incumbent Republican president George H. W. Bush and independent businessman Ross Perot. At 46 years old, he became the third-youngest president of the United States and the first president to be born in the Baby Boomer generation. Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. He signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. The Republican Party won unified control of Congress for the first time in 40 years in the 1994 elections, but Clinton was still comfortably re-elected in 1996, becoming the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win a second full term. Starting in the mid-1990s, he began an ideological evolution as he became much more conservative in his domestic policy, advocating for and signing the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, the State Children's Health Insurance Program and financial deregulation measures. He appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus—the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, eventually signing the Dayton Peace agreement. He also called for the expansion of NATO in Eastern Europe and many former Warsaw Pact members joined NATO during his presidency. Clinton's foreign policy in the Middle East saw him sign the Iraq Liberation Act which gave aid to groups against Saddam Hussein. He also participated in the Oslo I Accord and Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli–Palestinian peace process, and assisted the Northern Ireland peace process. Clinton's second term was dominated by the Monica Lewinsky scandal which began in 1996, when he allegedly had a sexual relationship with 22-year-old Monica Lewinsky, an intern at the White House. In January 1998, news of the affair made tabloid headlines. The scandal escalated throughout the year, culminating on December 19 when Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives, becoming the second U.S. president to be impeached after Andrew Johnson. The two impeachment articles that the House passed were centered around Clinton using the powers of the presidency to obstruct the investigation and that he lied under oath. In 1999, Clinton's impeachment trial began in the Senate. Clinton was acquitted on both charges as the Senate failed to cast 67 votes against him, the conviction threshold. Clinton left office in 2001 with the joint-highest approval rating of any U.S. president in the modern era, alongside Franklin D. Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan. His presidency has been ranked among the upper tier in historical rankings of U.S. presidents. However, his personal conduct and allegations of sexual assault have made him the subject of substantial scrutiny. Since leaving office, Clinton has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. He created the Clinton Foundation to address international causes such as the prevention of HIV/AIDS and global warming. In 2009, he was named the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Clinton and George W. Bush formed the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund. He has remained active in Democratic Party politics, campaigning for his wife's 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns.","[['is American', 'served'], ['served from', '1979 to 1981'], ['previously served

16,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Donald_Trump,Donald Trump,"Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American politician, media personality, and businessman who served as the 45th president of the United States from 2017 to 2021. Trump graduated from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania with a bachelor's degree in 1968. He became president of his father's real estate business in 1971 and renamed it The Trump Organization. He expanded the company's operations to building and renovating skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He later started side ventures, mostly by licensing his name. From 2004 to 2015, he co-produced and hosted the reality television series The Apprentice. Trump and his businesses have been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions, including six bankruptcies. Trump's political positions have been described as populist, protectionist, isolationist, and nationalist. He won the 2016 United States presidential election as the Republican nominee against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton despite losing the national popular vote. He became the first U.S. president with no prior military or government service. His election and policies sparked numerous protests. The 2017–2019 special counsel investigation led by Robert Mueller established that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to favor the election of Trump. Trump promoted conspiracy theories and made many false and misleading statements during his campaigns and presidency, to a degree unprecedented in American politics. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged or racist, and many as misogynistic. Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding towards building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a policy of family separations for apprehended migrants. He rolled back more than 100 environmental policies and regulations in an aggressive attempt to weaken environmental protections. Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 which cut taxes for individuals and businesses and rescinded the individual health insurance mandate penalty of the Affordable Care Act. He appointed 54 federal appellate judges and three United States Supreme Court justices. In foreign policy, Trump initiated a trade war with China and withdrew the U.S. from the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal. Trump met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un three times, but made no progress on denuclearization. He reacted slowly to the COVID-19 pandemic, ignored or contradicted many recommendations from health officials in his messaging, and promoted misinformation about unproven treatments and the need for testing. Trump lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden but refused to concede defeat, falsely claiming widespread electoral fraud and attempting to overturn the results by pressuring government officials, mounting scores of unsuccessful legal challenges, and obstructing the presidential transition. On January 6, 2021, Trump urged his supporters to march to the United States Capitol, which many of them then attacked, resulting in multiple deaths and interrupting the electoral vote count. In November 2022, he announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination in the 2024 presidential election. Trump is the only American president to have been impeached twice. After he pressured Ukraine in 2019 to investigate Biden, he was impeached by the House of Representatives for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in December. The Senate acquitted him of both charges in February 2020. The House of Representatives impeached Trump a second time in January 2021, for incitement of insurrection. The Senate acquitted him in February, after he had already left office. Since leaving office, Trump has remained heavily involved in the Republican Party, including making over 200 political endorsements during the 2022 midterm elections. Scholars and historians rank Trump as one of the worst presidents in American history.","[['is', 'American'], ['graduated from', 'Wharton School of University'], ['graduated with', ""bachelor 's

17,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Jimmy_Carter,Jimmy Carter,"James Earl Carter Jr. (born October 1, 1924) is an American former politician who served as the 39th president of the United States from 1977 to 1981. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the 76th governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975 and as a Georgia state senator from 1963 to 1967. Since leaving office, Carter has remained engaged in political and social projects, receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his humanitarian work. Born and raised in Plains, Georgia, Carter graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1946 with a Bachelor of Science degree and joined the United States Navy, serving on numerous submarines. After the death of his father in 1953, he left his naval career and returned home to Plains, where he assumed control of his family's peanut-growing business. He inherited comparatively little, because of his father's forgiveness of debts and the division of the estate amongst himself and his siblings. Nevertheless, his ambition to expand and grow the family's peanut farm was fulfilled. During this period, Carter was encouraged to oppose racial segregation and support the growing civil rights movement. He became an activist within the Democratic Party. From 1963 to 1967, Carter served in the Georgia State Senate, and in 1970 was elected as governor of Georgia, defeating former Governor Carl Sanders in the Democratic primary. He remained in office until 1975. Despite being a dark-horse candidate who was not well known outside of Georgia, he won the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination. In the 1976 presidential election, Carter ran as an outsider and narrowly defeated incumbent Republican president Gerald Ford. On his second day in office, Carter pardoned all Vietnam War draft evaders by issuing Proclamation 4483. During his term, two new cabinet-level departments—the Department of Energy and the Department of Education—were established. He created a national energy policy that included conservation, price control, and new technology. Carter pursued the Camp David Accords, the Panama Canal Treaties, and the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT II). On the economic front he confronted stagflation, a persistent combination of high inflation, high unemployment, and slow growth. The end of his presidency was marked by the 1979–1981 Iran hostage crisis, the 1979 energy crisis, the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, the Nicaraguan Revolution, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In response to the invasion, Carter escalated the Cold War when he ended détente, imposed a grain embargo against the Soviets, enunciated the Carter Doctrine, and led a 1980 Summer Olympics boycott in Moscow. He is the only president to have served a full term in office and not have appointed a justice to the Supreme Court. In the 1980 Democratic Party presidential primaries, he was challenged by Senator Ted Kennedy, but won re-nomination at the 1980 Democratic National Convention. Carter lost the 1980 presidential election in an electoral landslide to Republican nominee Ronald Reagan. Polls of historians and political scientists generally rank Carter as a below-average president, although his post-presidential activities have been viewed more favorably than his presidency. In 1982, Carter established the Carter Center, aimed at promoting and expanding human rights. In 2002, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in co-founding the Center. He has traveled extensively to conduct peace negotiations, monitor elections, and advance disease prevention and eradication in developing nations. Carter is considered a key figure in the nonprofit organization Habitat for Humanity. He has written over 30 books, ranging from political memoirs to poetry, while continuing to actively comment on ongoing American and global affairs, including the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. At 98 years old, Carter is both the oldest living and longest-lived president, as well as the one with the longest post-presidency, and his 76-year-long marriage makes him the longest-married president. He is also the third-oldest living person to have served as a state leader.","[['is', 'American'], ['served to', '1975'], ['served as', '76th governor of Georgia'], ['previously served as', 'governor

18,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.,Martin Luther King Jr.,"Martin Luther King Jr. (born Michael King Jr.; January 15, 1929 – April 4, 1968) was an American Baptist minister and activist, one of the most prominent leaders in the civil rights movement from 1955 until his assassination in 1968. An African American church leader and the son of early civil rights activist and minister Martin Luther King Sr., King advanced civil rights for people of color in the United States through nonviolence and civil disobedience. Inspired by his Christian beliefs and the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi, he led targeted, nonviolent resistance against Jim Crow laws and other forms of discrimination. King participated in and led marches for the right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other civil rights. He oversaw the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and later became the first president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). As president of the SCLC, he led the unsuccessful Albany Movement in Albany, Georgia, and helped organize some of the nonviolent 1963 protests in Birmingham, Alabama. King was one of the leaders of the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his ""I Have a Dream"" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. The civil rights movement achieved pivotal legislative gains in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. The SCLC put into practice the tactics of nonviolent protest with some success by strategically choosing the methods and places in which protests were carried out. There were several dramatic standoffs with segregationist authorities, who sometimes turned violent. Several times King would be jailed. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director J. Edgar Hoover considered King a radical and made him an object of the FBI's COINTELPRO from 1963 forward. FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties, spied on his personal life, and secretly recorded him. The FBI in 1964 mailed King a threatening anonymous letter, which he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide. On October 14, 1964, King won the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolent resistance. In 1965, he helped organize two of the three Selma to Montgomery marches. In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards poverty, capitalism, and the Vietnam War. In 1968, King was planning a national occupation of Washington, D.C., to be called the Poor People's Campaign, when he was assassinated on April 4 in Memphis, Tennessee. His death was followed by national mourning, as well as anger leading to riots in many U.S. cities. King was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2003.

19,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Ronald_Reagan,Ronald Reagan,"Ronald Wilson Reagan (/ˈreɪɡən/ RAY-gən; February 6, 1911 – June 5, 2004) was an American politician who served as the 40th president of the United States from 1981 to 1989. A member of the Republican Party from 1962 onward, he also served as the 33rd governor of California from 1967 to 1975 after having a career as a Hollywood actor and union leader. Reagan was born in Tampico, Illinois. He graduated from Eureka College in 1932 and began to work as a radio sports commentator in Iowa. In 1937, Reagan moved to California, where he found work as a film actor. From 1947 to 1952, Reagan served as president of the Screen Actors Guild, during which time he worked to root out alleged communist influence within it. In the 1950s, he moved to a career in television and became a spokesman for General Electric. From 1959 to 1960, he again served as president of the Screen Actors Guild. In 1964, his speech ""A Time for Choosing"" earned him national attention as a new conservative figure. Building a network of supporters, Reagan was elected governor of California in 1966. During his governorship, he raised taxes, turned the state budget deficit into a surplus, challenged protesters at UC Berkeley, and ordered in National Guard troops during a period of protest movements. After failed presidential bids in 1968 and 1976, challenging and nearly defeating sitting president Gerald Ford in the latter's Republican primaries, Reagan easily won the Republican nomination in the 1980 presidential election and went on to defeat incumbent Democratic president Jimmy Carter. At the time of his first inauguration, Reagan was the oldest person to assume the U.S. presidency. Early in his presidency, he began implementing new political and economic initiatives. His supply-side economics policies—dubbed ""Reaganomics""—advocated tax reduction, economic deregulation, and reduction in government spending. In his first term, he survived an assassination attempt, spurred the war on drugs, invaded Grenada, and fought public-sector labor unions. Reagan ran for reelection in the 1984 presidential election, defeating Carter's vice president, Walter Mondale, in an electoral landslide. Foreign affairs dominated Reagan's second term, including the bombing of Libya, Iran–Iraq War, Iran–Contra affair, and ongoing Cold War. In a speech in 1987, four years after he publicly described the Soviet Union as an ""evil empire"", Reagan challenged Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to open the Berlin Wall. He transitioned Cold War policy from détente to rollback by escalating an arms race with the Soviet Union while engaging in talks with Gorbachev. The talks culminated in the INF Treaty, which shrank both countries' nuclear arsenals. Over Reagan's two terms, the U.S. economy saw a reduction of inflation from 12.5 percent to 4.4 percent and an average real GDP annual growth of 3.6 percent. He had enacted cuts in domestic discretionary spending, cut taxes, and increased military spending, which contributed to a near tripling of the federal debt. Reagan had planned an active post-presidency, but he disclosed in November 1994 that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease earlier that year. His public appearances became more infrequent as the disease progressed. Reagan died at his home in Los Angeles on June 5, 2004. His tenure constituted a realignment toward conservative policies in the United States and he is often considered a conservative icon. Evaluations of his presidency among historians and the general public place him among the upper tier of American presidents.","[['was', 'American politician'], ['was', 'American'], ['was',

20,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Germany,Germany,"Germany (German: Deutschland, pronounced [ˈdɔʏtʃlant]), officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a country in Central Europe. It is the second most populous country in Europe after Russia, and the most populous member state of the European Union. Germany is situated between the Baltic and North seas to the north, and the Alps to the south; it covers an area of 357,022 square kilometres (137,847 sq mi), with a population of almost 84 million within its 16 constituent states. Germany borders Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria and Switzerland to the south, and France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands to the west. The nation's capital and most populous city is Berlin and its financial centre is Frankfurt; the largest urban area is the Ruhr. Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented before AD 100. In 962, the Kingdom of Germany formed the bulk of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. Following the Napoleonic Wars and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the German Confederation was formed in 1815. Formal unification of Germany into the modern nation-state was commenced on 18 August 1866 with the North German Confederation Treaty establishing the Prussia-led North German Confederation later transformed in 1871 into the German Empire. After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918–1919, the Empire was in turn transformed into the semi-presidential Weimar Republic. The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 led to the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship, World War II, and the Holocaust. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of Allied occupation, Germany as a whole was organized into two separate polities with limited sovereignity: the Federal Republic of Germany, generally known as West Germany, and the German Democratic Republic, East Germany, while Berlin continued its Four Power status. The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the European Economic Community and the European Union, while the German Democratic Republic was a communist Eastern Bloc state and member of the Warsaw Pact. After the fall of communism, German reunification saw the former East German states join the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990—becoming a federal parliamentary republic. Germany is a great power with a strong economy; it has the largest economy in Europe, the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the fifth-largest by PPP. As a global power in industrial, scientific and technological sectors, it is both the world's third-largest exporter and importer. As a highly developed country, which ranks ninth on the Human Development Index, it offers social security and a universal health care system, environmental protections, a tuition-free university education, and it is ranked as sixteenth-most peaceful country in the world. Germany is a member of the United Nations, the European Union, NATO, the Council of Europe, the G7, the G20 and the OECD. It has the third-greatest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.","[['is country in', 'Central Europe'], ['Republic of', 'Germany'], ['is', 'country'], ['is', 'second most populous country in Europe

22,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Vietnam_War,Vietnam War,"The Vietnam War (also known by ) was a conflict in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia from 1 November 1955 to the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975. It was the second of the Indochina Wars and was officially fought between North Vietnam and South Vietnam. The north was supported by the Soviet Union, China, and other communist states, while the south was supported by the United States and other anti-communist allies. The war is widely considered to be a Cold War-era proxy war. It lasted almost 20 years, with direct U.S. involvement ending in 1973. The conflict also spilled over into neighboring states, exacerbating the Laotian Civil War and the Cambodian Civil War, which ended with all three countries becoming communist states by 1975. After the French military withdrawal from Indochina in 1954 – following their defeat in the First Indochina War – the Viet Minh took control of North Vietnam, and the U.S. assumed financial and military support for the South Vietnamese state. The Viet Cong (VC), a South Vietnamese common front under the direction of the north, initiated a guerrilla war in the south. The People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN), also known as the North Vietnamese Army (NVA), engaged in more conventional warfare with U.S. and South Vietnamese forces (ARVN). North Vietnam had also invaded Laos in 1958, establishing the Ho Chi Minh Trail to supply and reinforce the VC. By 1963, the north had sent 40,000 soldiers to fight in the south. U.S. involvement increased under President John F. Kennedy, from just under a thousand military advisors in 1959 to 23,000 by 1964. Following the Gulf of Tonkin incident in August 1964, the U.S. Congress passed a resolution that gave President Lyndon B. Johnson broad authority to increase American military presence in Vietnam, without a formal declaration of war. Johnson ordered the deployment of combat units for the first time, and dramatically increased the number of American troops to 184,000. U.S. and South Vietnamese forces relied on air superiority and overwhelming firepower to conduct search and destroy operations, involving ground forces, artillery, and airstrikes. The U.S. also conducted a large-scale strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam, and continued significantly building up it's forces, despite little progress being made. In 1968, North Vietnamese forces launched the Tet Offensive; though it was a military defeat for the north, it became a political victory for them as well, as it caused U.S. domestic support for the war to fade. By the end of the year, the VC held little territory and were sidelined by the PAVN. In 1969, North Vietnam declared the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam. Operations crossed national borders, and the U.S. bombed North Vietnamese supply routes in Laos and Cambodia. The 1970 deposing of the Cambodian monarch, Norodom Sihanouk, resulted in a PAVN invasion of the country (at the request of the Khmer Rouge), and then a U.S.-ARVN counter-invasion, escalating the Cambodian Civil War. After the election of Richard Nixon in 1969, a policy of ""Vietnamization"" began, which saw the conflict fought by an expanded ARVN, while U.S. forces withdrew in the face of increasing domestic opposition. U.S. ground forces had largely withdrawn by early 1972, and their operations were limited to air support, artillery support, advisors, and materiel shipments. The Paris Peace Accords of January 1973 saw all U.S. forces withdrawn; accords were broken almost immediately, and fighting continued for two more years. Phnom Penh fell to the Khmer Rouge on 17 April 1975, while the 1975 spring offensive saw the Fall of Saigon to the PAVN on 30 April, marking the end of the war; North and South Vietnam were reunified the following year. The war exacted an enormous human cost: estimates of the number of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed range from 966,000 to 3 million. Some 275,000–310,000 Cambodians, 20,000–62,000 Laotians, and 58,220 U.S. service members also died in the conflict, and a further 1,626 remain missing in action. The end of the Vietnam War would precipitate the Vietnamese boat people and the larger Indochina refugee crisis, which saw millions of refugees leave Indochina, an estimated 250,000 of whom perished at sea. Once in power, the Khmer Rouge carried out the Cambodian genocide, while conflict between them and the unified Vietnam would eventually escalating into the Cambodian–Vietnamese War, which toppled the Khmer Rouge government in 1979. In response, China invaded Vietnam, with subsequent border conflicts lasting until 1991. Within the United States, the war gave rise to what was referred to as Vietnam Syndrome, a public aversion to American overseas military involvements, which, together with the Watergate scandal contributed to the crisis of confidence that affected America throughout the 1970s.","[['was', 'conflict in Vietnam from 1 November 1955 to fall on 30 April 1975'], ['was conflict in', 'Vietnam'], ['was conflict from', '1 November 1955 to fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975'], ['was conflict from', '1 November 1955'], ['was', 'conflict in Vietnam from 1 November 1955 to fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975'], ['was', 'conflict in Vietnam from 1 November 1955 to fall of Saigon'], ['was', 'conflict in Vietnam from 1 November 1955 to fall'], ['was', 'conflict in Vietnam from 1 November 1955'], ['was conflict from', '1 November 1955 to fall on 30 April 1975'], ['was conflict from', '1 November 1955 to fall of Saigon'], ['was', 'conflict'], ['was conflict from', '1 November 1955 to fall'], ['was second of', 'Indochina Wars'], ['was', 'officially fought'], ['was fought between', 'North Vietnam'], ['was', 'second'], ['was officially fought between', 'North Vietnam'], ['was', 'fought'], ['lasted at_time', 'almost 20 years'], ['ended', 'with three countries becoming'], ['ended', 'three countries becoming'], [""'s forces despite"", 'progress'], ['has', 'forces despite progress made'], ['has', 'forces despite little progress made'], [""'s forces despite"", 'little progress'], ['has', 'forces'], ['political victory for', 'them'], ['was', 'though military defeat for north'], ['became', 'though military defeat for north'], ['caused', 'U.S. domestic support war fade'], ['was military', 'north'], ['became', 'political victory'], ['was defeat for', 'north'], ['was', 'though military defeat'], ['became', 'political victory for them'], ['caused', 'U.S. support for war to fade'], ['became', 'military defeat for north'], ['became', 'military defeat'], ['became', 'though defeat'], ['caused', 'U.S. domestic support war to fade'], ['was', 'though defeat'], ['was', 'though defeat for north'], ['was', 'defeat'], ['became', 'though defeat for north'], ['was military defeat for', 'north'], ['became', 'victory'], ['became', 'victory for them'], ['became', 'defeat'], ['caused', 'U.S. support war to fade'], ['victory for', 'them'], ['became', 'though military defeat'], ['caused', 'U.S. support for war fade'], ['caused', 'U.S. support war fade'], ['caused', 'U.S. domestic support for war to fade'], ['was', 'military defeat'], ['caused', 'U.S. domestic support for war fade'], ['became', 'defeat for north']]","[['warOn', 'conflict'], ['attackOn', 'Vietnam'], ['endedOn', '1_November'], ['endedOn', '30_April'], ['in', 'Vietnam'], ['marchOn', 'Saigon'], ['from', '1_November'], ['endOf', 'conflict'], ['republicOf', 'Vietnam'], ['dateOf', '1_November'], ['fallOf', 'Saigon'], ['withdrewFrom', 'conflict'], ['from', 'Vietnam'], ['type', 'conflict'], ['firstOf', 'Indochina_Wars'], ['between', 'North_Vietnam'], ['lasted', 'almost_20_years'], ['endedBecoming', 'three_countries'], ['ended', 'three_countries'], ['forcesDespite', 'progress'], ['despite', 'forces'], ['despite', 'little_progress'], ['has', 'forces'], ['victoryFor', 'them'], ['for', 'though_military_defeat'], ['for', 'north'], ['caused', 'U.S._domestic_support_war_fade'], ['military', 'north'], ['became', 'political_victory'], ['type', 'though_military_defeat'], ['for', 'political_victory'], ['pushedFor', 'U.S._support'], ['supportFor', 'war'], ['becameFor', 'military_defeat'], ['became', 'military_defeat'], ['becameThough', 'though_defeat'], ['caused', 'U.S._domestic_support_war'], ['for', 'though_defeat'], ['victoryBecame', 'victory'], ['foughtFor', 'victory'], ['toSupport', 'U.S.'], ['vietnamSupport', 'war'], ['againBecame', 'though_military_defeat'], ['supportFor', 'war_fade'], ['caused', 'U.S.'], ['caused', 'war_fade'], ['pushedFor', 'U.S._domestic_support'], ['type', 'military_defeat'], ['defeatFor', 'defeat']]"
23,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series),The Walking Dead (TV series),"The Walking Dead is an American post-apocalyptic horror television series based on the comic book series of the same name by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard—together forming the core of The Walking Dead franchise. The series features a large ensemble cast as survivors of a zombie apocalypse trying to stay alive under near-constant threat of attacks from zombies known as ""walkers"" (among other nicknames). With the collapse of modern civilization, these survivors must confront other human survivors who have formed groups and communities with their own sets of laws and morals, sometimes leading to open, hostile conflict between them. Andrew Lincoln played the lead character Rick Grimes until his departure in the ninth season. Other long-standing cast members have included Norman Reedus, Steven Yeun, Chandler Riggs, Melissa McBride, Lauren Cohan, Danai Gurira, Josh McDermitt, Christian Serratos, Seth Gilliam, Ross Marquand and Jeffrey Dean Morgan. The Walking Dead is produced by AMC Studios in the state of Georgia, with most filming taking place in the outdoor spaces of Riverwood Studios near Senoia, Georgia. The series was initially adapted from the comic by Frank Darabont, who also served as showrunner for the first season. However, conflicts between Darabont and AMC forced his departure from the series and resulted in multiple lawsuits by Darabont and others. Glen Mazzara, Scott M. Gimple, and Angela Kang served as subsequent showrunners. The series premiered on October 31, 2010, and is exclusively broadcast on cable channel AMC in the United States and internationally through the Fox Networks Group and Disney+. The eleventh and final season premiered on August 22, 2021 and concluded on November 20, 2022. Beginning with its third season, The Walking Dead has attracted the most 18- to 49-year-old viewers of any cable or broadcast television series, though viewership has declined in later seasons. In addition, the series has been overall positively received by critics. It has been nominated for several awards, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama and the Writers Guild of America Award for New Series. AMC has also expanded the series into related media, including the spin-off series Fear the Walking Dead (2015–present), The Walking Dead: World Beyond (2020–2021), and Tales of the Walking Dead (2022) as well as several webisodes and video games. Three further spinoffs have been announced: The Walking Dead: Dead City featuring Maggie and Negan, The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon featuring the titular character and an untitled series featuring Rick and Michonne.","[['is', 'post-apocalyptic horror television series'], ['is', 'American'], ['is', 'American horror television series'], ['is', 'American post-apocalyptic horror television series'], ['is', 'post-apocalyptic'], ['is', 'horror television series'], ['is', 'horror television series'], ['is', 'post-apocalyptic horror television series'], ['is', 'American horror television series'], ['is', 'American post-apocalyptic horror television series'], ['features', 'ensemble cast'], ['features ensemble cast as', 'survivors of zombie apocalypse'], ['features ensemble cast as', 'survivors'], ['features', 'large ensemble cast'], ['features ensemble cast as', 'survivors of zombie apocalypse trying'], ['is produced by', 'AMC Studios'], ['is', 'produced by AMC Studios in state of Georgia'], ['is', 'produced by AMC Studios in state'], ['is', 'produced by AMC Studios in state'], ['is produced by', 'AMC Studios'], ['is', 'produced by AMC Studios in state of Georgia'], ['was', 'initially adapted from comic by Frank Darabont'], ['was', 'adapted from comic by Frank Darabont'], ['was adapted by', 'Frank Darabont'], ['was initially adapted by', 'Frank Darabont'], ['premiered on', 'October 31 2010'], ['is broadcast in', 'United States'], ['is', 'broadcast on cable channel AMC in United States'], ['is', 'exclusively broadcast on cable channel AMC through Fox Networks Group'], ['is', 'broadcast in United States through Fox Networks Group'], ['is', 'broadcast on cable channel AMC through Fox Networks Group'], ['is exclusively broadcast in', 'United States'], ['is exclusively broadcast on', 'cable channel AMC'], ['is exclusively broadcast through', 'Fox Networks Group'], ['is', 'broadcast'], ['is broadcast through', 'Fox Networks Group'], ['is', 'exclusively broadcast'], ['is', 'exclusively broadcast on cable channel AMC in United States'], ['is broadcast on', 'cable channel AMC'], ['is', 'exclusively broadcast in United States through Fox Networks Group'], ['is', 'broadcast on cable channel AMC in United States through Fox Networks Group'], ['is', 'exclusively broadcast on cable channel AMC in United States through Fox Networks Group'], ['has', 'has overall positively received by critics'], ['has', 'In addition has overall received by critics'], ['has', 'has overall received by critics'], ['has', 'has received by critics'], ['has', 'has positively received by critics'], ['has', 'In addition has received by critics'], ['has', 'In addition has positively received by critics'], ['has', 'In addition has overall positively received by critics'], ['has', 'has nominated for several awards'], ['has', 'has nominated for awards'], ['has', 'has nominated for several awards including Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series'], ['has', 'has nominated'], ['has', 'has nominated for several awards including Golden Globe Award'], ['has', 'has nominated for awards including Golden Globe Award'], ['has', 'has nominated for awards including Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series']]","[['type', 'post-apocalyptic_horror_television_series'], ['type', 'American_horror_television_series'], ['type', 'American_post-apocalyptic_horror_television_series'], ['type', 'horror_television_series'], ['features', 'ensemble_cast'], ['castOf', 'survivors'], ['survivorsOf', 'zombie_apocalypse'], ['featuresAs', 'survivors'], ['features', 'large_ensemble_cast'], ['producedBy', 'AMC_Studios'], ['productionOf', 'AMC_Studios'], ['secretaryOf', 'state'], ['stateOf', 'Georgia'], ['isIn', 'AMC_Studios'], ['isIn', 'state'], ['adaptedBy', 'Frank_Darabont'], ['premieredOn', 'October'], ['broadcastIn', 'United_States'], ['broadcastIn', 'cable_channel'], ['exclusivelyThrough', 'cable_channel'], ['broadcastThrough', 'AMC'], ['isThrough', 'Fox_Networks_Group'], ['broadcastThrough', 'United_States'], ['airsOn', 'cable_channel_AMC'], ['airsIn', 'AMC'], ['acclaimedBy', 'critics'], ['by', 'addition'], ['nominatedFor', 'several_awards'], ['nominatedFor', 'awards'], ['nominatedFor', 'Golden_Globe_Award'], ['nominatedFor', 'Best_Television_Series'], ['including', 'several_awards'], ['including', 'Golden_Globe_Award'], ['including', 'awards']]"
24,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/London,London,"London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom, with a population of just under 9 million. It stands on the River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea, and has been a major settlement for two millennia. The City of London, its ancient core and financial centre, was founded by the Romans as Londinium and retains its medieval boundaries. The City of Westminster, to the west of the City of London, has for centuries hosted the national government and parliament. Since the 19th century, the name ""London"" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which largely comprises Greater London, governed by the Greater London Authority. As one of the world's major global cities, London exerts a strong influence on its arts, entertainment, fashion, commerce and finance, education, health care, media, science and technology, tourism, and transport and communications. Its GDP (€801.66 billion in 2017) makes it the largest urban economy in Europe, and it is one of the major financial centres in the world. With Europe's largest concentration of higher education institutions, it is home to some of the highest-ranked academic institutions in the world—Imperial College London in natural and applied sciences, the London School of Economics in social sciences, and the comprehensive University College London. London is the most visited city in Europe and has the busiest city airport system in the world. The London Underground is the oldest rapid transit system in the world. London is home to the most 5-star hotels of any city. London's diverse cultures encompass over 300 languages. The mid-2018 population of Greater London of about 9 million made it Europe's third-most populous city, accounting for 13.4% of the population of the United Kingdom and over 16% of the population of England. The Greater London Built-up Area is the fourth-most populous in Europe with about 9.8 million inhabitants at the 2011 census. The London metropolitan area is the third-most populous in Europe with about 14 million inhabitants in 2016, granting London the status of a megacity. London has four World Heritage Sites: the Tower of London; Kew Gardens; the combined Palace of Westminster, Westminster Abbey, and St Margaret's Church; and also the historic settlement in Greenwich, where the Royal Observatory, Greenwich defines the prime meridian (0° longitude) and Greenwich Mean Time. Other landmarks include Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, Piccadilly Circus, St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge, and Trafalgar Square. London has many museums, galleries, libraries and cultural venues, including the British Museum, National Gallery, Natural History Museum, Tate Modern, British Library, and numerous West End theatres. Important sporting events held in London include the FA Cup Final (held annually at Wembley Stadium), Wimbledon Tennis Championships and the London Marathon. In 2012, London became the first city to host three Summer Olympic Games.","[['city of', 'England'], ['largest city of', 'England'], ['is capital with', 'population'], ['is', 'capital'], ['is capital with', 'population of just under 9 million'], ['stands in', 'England'], ['stands at', 'head of 80 km estuary down to North Sea'], ['stands in', 'south east England'], ['stands in', 'east England'], ['been', 'settlement'], ['been', 'major settlement'], ['been settlement for', 'two millennia'], ['been major settlement for', 'two millennia'], ['stands at', 'head'], ['stands at', 'head of 80 km estuary'], ['stands on', 'River Thames'], ['been major', 'millennia'], ['exerts', 'influence'], ['exerts influence As', ""one world 's major cities""], ['exerts influence As', ""one world 's global cities""], ['exerts influence As', ""one world 's cities""], ['exerts influence As', ""one of world 's cities""], ['exerts influence As', ""one of world 's major cities""], ['exerts', 'strong influence'], ['exerts influence As', ""one of world 's major global cities""], ['exerts', 'strong influence on its arts'], ['exerts influence As', ""one of world 's global cities""], ['exerts', 'influence on its arts'], ['exerts influence As', ""one world 's major global cities""], ['largest economy in', 'Europe'], ['largest urban economy in', 'Europe'], ['urban economy in', 'Europe'], ['economy in', 'Europe'], ['is home With', ""Europe 's largest concentration of education institutions""], ['is home With', ""Europe 's largest concentration of higher education institutions""], ['is home With', ""Europe 's concentration of education institutions""], ['is home With', ""Europe 's largest concentration""], ['is home With', ""Europe 's concentration of higher education institutions""], ['is', 'home'], ['is home With', ""Europe 's concentration""], ['is city in', 'Europe'], ['is visited city in', 'Europe'], ['is most visited city in', 'Europe'], ['has', 'city airport system in world'], ['is', 'most visited city'], ['has', 'city airport system'], ['is', 'city'], ['is', 'visited city'], ['has', 'busiest city airport system in world'], ['has', 'busiest city airport system'], ['has', 'diverse cultures'], ['accounting for', '13.4 % of population'], ['accounting for', '13.4 % of population of United Kingdom'], ['accounting for', '13.4 %'], ['has', 'four World Heritage Sites'], ['became In', '2012']]","[['cityOf', 'England'], ['isWith', 'population'], ['type', 'capital'], ['standsIn', 'England'], ['headTo', 'head'], ['downTo', 'North_Sea'], ['standsIn', 'south_east_England'], ['standsIn', 'east_England'], ['hadBeen', 'settlement'], ['been', 'major_settlement'], ['settlementFor', 'two_millennia'], ['standsAt', 'head'], ['standsOn', 'River'], ['hadBeen', 'millennia'], ['cityExerts', 'influence'], ['influenceAs', ""one_world_'s_major_cities""], ['influenceAs', ""one_world_'s_global_cities""], ['influenceAs', ""one_world_'s_cities""], ['oneOf', ""world_'s_cities""], ['oneOf', ""world_'s_major_cities""], ['exerts', 'strong_influence'], ['oneOf', ""world_'s_major_global_cities""], ['reliesOn', 'strong_influence'], ['dependsOn', 'its_arts'], ['oneOf', ""world_'s_global_cities""], ['dependsOn', 'influence'], ['influenceAs', ""one_world_'s_major_global_cities""], ['largestIn', 'Europe'], ['boastsOf', ""Europe_'s_largest_concentration""], ['collegeOf', 'education_institutions'], ['numberOf', 'higher_education_institutions'], ['oneOf', ""Europe_'s_concentration""], ['isWith', ""Europe_'s_largest_concentration""], ['my', 'home'], ['isWith', ""Europe_'s_concentration""], ['in', 'city_airport_system'], ['airportIn', 'world'], ['isVisited', 'most_visited_city'], ['has', 'city_airport_system'], ['type', 'city'], ['isVisited', 'visited_city'], ['isIn', 'busiest_city_airport_system'], ['has', 'busiest_city_airport_system'], ['has', 'diverse_cultures'], ['accountingOf', '13.4_%'], ['censusOf', 'population'], ['boroughOf', 'United_Kingdom'], ['accountingFor', '13.4_%'], ['has', 'four_World_Heritage_Sites']]"
25,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/World_War_I,World War I,"World War I or the First World War, often abbreviated as WWI or WW1, and referred to by some Anglophone authors as the ""Great War"" or the ""War to End All Wars"", was a global conflict which lasted from 1914 to 1918, and is considered one of the deadliest conflicts in history. Belligerents included much of Europe, the Russian Empire, the United States, and the Ottoman Empire, with fighting occurring throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Pacific, and parts of Asia. An estimated 9 million soldiers were killed in combat, plus another 23 million wounded, while 5 million civilians died as a result of military action, hunger, and disease. Millions more died in genocides within the Ottoman Empire and in the 1918 influenza pandemic, which was exacerbated by the movement of combatants during the war. Prior to 1914, the European great powers were divided between the Triple Entente, comprising France, Russia, and Britain, and the Triple Alliance, containing Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. Tensions in the Balkans came to a head on 28 June 1914 following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the Austro-Hungarian heir, by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb. Austria-Hungary blamed Serbia, which led to the July Crisis, an unsuccessful attempt to avoid conflict through diplomacy. On 28 July 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, and Russia came to the latter's defence. By 4 August, the system of entangling alliances drew in Germany, France, and Britain, along with their respective colonies, although Italy initially remained neutral. In November 1914, the Ottoman Empire, Germany, and Austria-Hungary formed the Central Powers, and on 26 April 1915, Italy joined Britain, France, Russia, and Serbia as the Allies of World War I. Facing a war on two fronts, German strategy in 1914 was to concentrate its forces on defeating France in six weeks, before moving them to the Eastern Front and doing the same to Russia. However, this was defeated at the Marne in September 1914, and the year ended with the two sides facing each other along the Western Front, a continuous series of trenches stretching from the English Channel to Switzerland. The frontlines in the West changed little until 1917, while the Eastern Front was far more fluid, with both Austria-Hungary and Russia gaining and losing large swathes of territory. Other significant theatres included the Middle East, Italy, Asia Pacific, and the Balkans, which drew Bulgaria, Romania, and Greece into the war. Over the course of 1915, both Russia and Austria-Hungary suffered enormous casualties in the East, while Allied offensives in Gallipoli and on the Western Front ended in failure. German attacks at Verdun in 1916, and a combined Franco-British offensive on the Somme cost participants heavy losses for limited strategic gains, while the Russian Brusilov offensive ground to a halt after early success. By 1917, Russia was on the verge of revolution, and the failure of the French Nivelle Offensive, as well as costly British attacks in Flanders, meant all belligerents were short of manpower and under severe economic stress. Shortages caused by the Allied naval blockade led Germany to initiate unrestricted submarine warfare in early 1917, bringing the previously-neutral United States into the war on 6 April 1917. In Russia, the Bolsheviks seized power in the 1917 October Revolution and exited the war with the March 1918 Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, freeing up large numbers of German troops. The German General Staff used these additional resources to launch the March 1918 offensive, which was halted by stubborn Allied defence, heavy casualties, and supply shortages. When the Allies began the Hundred Days Offensive in August, the Imperial German Army continued to fight hard but could only slow the advance, not stop it. Towards the end of 1918, the Central Powers began to collapse; Bulgaria signed an armistice on 29 September, followed by the Ottomans on 31 October, then Austria-Hungary on 3 November. Isolated, facing the German Revolution at home and a military on the verge of mutiny, Kaiser Wilhelm abdicated on 9 November, and the new German government signed the Armistice of 11 November 1918, bringing the conflict to a close. The Paris Peace Conference of 1919–1920 imposed various settlements on the defeated powers, with the best-known of these being the Treaty of Versailles. The dissolution of the Russian Empire in 1917, the German Empire in 1918, the Austria-Hungarian Empire in 1920, and the Ottoman Empire in 1922, led to numerous uprisings and the creation of independent states, including Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. For reasons that are still debated, failure to manage the instability that resulted from this upheaval during the interwar period ended with the outbreak of World War II in September 1939.","[['referred as', 'Great War'], ['referred to', 'to Anglophone authors'], ['abbreviated as', 'WWI'], ['abbreviated as', 'WWI'], ['often abbreviated as', 'WWI'], ['often abbreviated as', 'WWI'], ['referred to', 'to authors'], ['doing', 'same']]","[['referredAs', 'Great_War'], ['referredTo', 'Anglophone_authors'], ['abbreviatedAs', 'WWI'], ['referredTo', 'authors']]"
26,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/California,California,"California is a state in the Western United States, located along the Pacific Coast. With nearly 39.2 million residents across a total area of approximately 163,696 square miles (423,970 km2), it is the most populous U.S. state and the 3rd largest by area. It is also the most populated subnational entity in North America and the 34th most populous in the world. The Greater Los Angeles area and the San Francisco Bay Area are the nation's second and fifth most populous urban regions respectively, with the former having more than 18.7 million residents and the latter having over 9.6 million. Sacramento is the state's capital, while Los Angeles is the most populous city in the state and the second most populous city in the country. San Francisco is the second most densely populated major city in the country. Los Angeles County is the country's most populous, while San Bernardino County is the largest county by area in the country. California borders Oregon to the north, Nevada and Arizona to the east, the Mexican state of Baja California to the south; and has a coastline along the Pacific Ocean to the west. The economy of the state of California is the largest in the United States, with a $3.4 trillion gross state product (GSP) as of 2022. It is the largest sub-national economy in the world. If California were a sovereign nation, it would rank as the world's fifth-largest economy as of 2022, behind Germany and ahead of India, as well as the 37th most populous. The Greater Los Angeles area and the San Francisco Bay Area are the nation's second- and third-largest urban economies ($1.0 trillion and $0.5 trillion respectively as of 2020). The San Francisco Bay Area Combined Statistical Area had the nation's highest gross domestic product per capita ($106,757) among large primary statistical areas in 2018, and is home to five of the world's ten largest companies by market capitalization and four of the world's ten richest people. Prior to European colonization, California was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre-Columbian North America and contained the highest Native American population density north of what is now Mexico. European exploration in the 16th and 17th centuries led to the colonization of California by the Spanish Empire. In 1804, it was included in Alta California province within the Viceroyalty of New Spain. The area became a part of Mexico in 1821, following its successful war for independence, but was ceded to the United States in 1848 after the Mexican–American War. The California Gold Rush started in 1848 and led to dramatic social and demographic changes, including large-scale immigration into California, a worldwide economic boom, and the California genocide of indigenous people. The western portion of Alta California was then organized and admitted as the 31st state on September 9, 1850, following the Compromise of 1850. Notable contributions to popular culture, for example in entertainment and sports, have their origins in California. The state also has made noteworthy contributions in the fields of communication, information, innovation, environmentalism, economics, and politics. It is the home of Hollywood, the oldest and one of the largest film industries in the world, which has had a profound influence upon global entertainment. It is considered the origin of the hippie counterculture, beach and car culture, and the personal computer, among other innovations. The San Francisco Bay Area and the Greater Los Angeles Area are widely seen as the centers of the global technology and film industries, respectively. California's economy is very diverse: 58% of it is based on finance, government, real estate services, technology, and professional, scientific, and technical business services. Although it accounts for only 1.5% of the state's economy, California's agriculture industry has the highest output of any U.S. state. California's ports and harbors handle about a third of all U.S. imports, most originating in Pacific Rim international trade. The state's extremely diverse geography ranges from the Pacific Coast and metropolitan areas in the west to the Sierra Nevada mountains in the east, and from the redwood and Douglas fir forests in the northwest to the Mojave Desert in the southeast. The Central Valley, a major agricultural area, dominates the state's center. California is well known for its warm Mediterranean climate and monsoon seasonal weather. The large size of the state results in climates that vary from moist temperate rainforest in the north to arid desert in the interior, as well as snowy alpine in the mountains.","[['is', 'state'],

27,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/The_Beatles,The Beatles,"The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960, that comprised John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. They are regarded as the most influential band of all time and were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music's recognition as an art form. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock 'n' roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways; the band also explored music styles ranging from folk and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements. Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles evolved from Lennon's previous group, the Quarrymen, and built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after signing to EMI Records and achieving their first hit, ""Love Me Do"", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed ""Beatlemania"", the band acquired the nickname ""the Fab Four"", with Epstein, Martin or another member of the band's entourage sometimes informally referred to as a ""fifth Beatle"". By early 1964, the Beatles were international stars and had achieved unprecedented levels of critical and commercial success. They became a leading force in Britain's cultural resurgence, ushering in the British Invasion of the United States pop market, and soon made their film debut with A Hard Day's Night (1964). A growing desire to refine their studio efforts, coupled with the untenable nature of their concert tours, led to the band's retirement from live performances in 1966. At this time, they produced records of greater sophistication, including the albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and enjoyed further commercial success with The Beatles (also known as ""the White Album"", 1968) and Abbey Road (1969). The success of these records heralded the album era, as albums became the dominant form of record consumption over singles; they also increased public interest in psychedelic drugs and Eastern spirituality, and furthered advancements in electronic music, album art and music videos. In 1968, they founded Apple Corps, a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects related to the band's legacy. After the group's break-up in 1970, all principal former members enjoyed success as solo artists and some partial reunions have occurred. Lennon was murdered in 1980 and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active. The Beatles are the best-selling music act of all time, with estimated sales of 600 million units worldwide. They hold the record for most number-one albums on the UK Albums Chart (15), most number-one hits on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart (20), and most singles sold in the UK (21.9 million). The band received many accolades, including seven Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards, an Academy Award (for Best Original Song Score for the 1970 documentary film Let It Be) and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and each principal member was inducted individually between 1994 and 2015. In 2004 and 2011, the group topped Rolling Stone's lists of the greatest artists in history. Time magazine named them among the 20th century's 100 most important people.","[['were', 'English rock band formed'], ['were', 'English rock band'], ['were', 'English rock band formed in Liverpool in

28,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Robert_Downey_Jr.,Robert Downey Jr.,"Robert John Downey Jr. (born April 4, 1965) is an American actor and producer. His career has been characterized by critical and popular success in his youth, followed by a period of substance abuse and legal troubles, before a resurgence of commercial success later in his career. In 2008, Downey was named by Time magazine among the 100 most influential people in the world, and from 2013 to 2015, he was listed by Forbes as Hollywood's highest-paid actor. At the age of five, he made his acting debut in his father Robert Downey Sr.'s film Pound in 1970. He subsequently worked with the Brat Pack in the teen films Weird Science (1985) and Less than Zero (1987). In 1992, Downey portrayed the title character in the biopic Chaplin, for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor and won a BAFTA Award. Following a stint at the Corcoran Substance Abuse Treatment Facility on drug charges, he joined the TV series Ally McBeal, for which he won a Golden Globe Award. He was fired from the show in the wake of drug charges in 2000 and 2001. He stayed in a court-ordered drug treatment program and has maintained his sobriety since 2003. Initially, completion bond companies would not insure Downey, until Mel Gibson paid the insurance bond for the 2003 film The Singing Detective. He went on to star in the black comedy Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005), the thriller Zodiac (2007), and the action comedy Tropic Thunder (2008); for the latter, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Downey gained global recognition for starring as Tony Stark in ten films within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, beginning with Iron Man (2008), and leading up to Avengers: Endgame (2019). He has also played the title character in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes (2009), which earned him his second Golden Globe, and its sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011).","[['is',

29,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Roger_Federer,Roger Federer,"Roger Federer (German: [ˈrɔdʒər ˈfeːdərər]; born 8 August 1981) is a Swiss former professional tennis player. He was ranked world No. 1 by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for 310 weeks, including a record 237 consecutive weeks, and finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. He won 103 ATP singles titles, the second most of all time, including 20 Grand Slam singles titles, a record eight men's singles Wimbledon titles, an Open Era record-tying five men's singles US Open titles, and a record-tying six year-end championships. Federer played during an era where he dominated men's tennis along with Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic as the Big Three, collectively considered by some to be the three most successful male tennis players of all time. Federer's 20 Grand Slam singles titles also put him at third most of all time, only behind Djokovic with 21 and record holder Nadal with 22, as of the end of 2022 season when Federer retired. A Wimbledon junior champion in 1998 and former ball boy, Federer won his first major singles title at Wimbledon in 2003 at age 21. Between 2003 and 2009 Federer played in 21 out of 28 major singles finals. He won 3 of the 4 majors and the ATP Finals in 2004, 2006, and 2007 as well as 5 consecutive titles at both Wimbledon and the US Open. He completed the career Grand Slam at the 2009 French Open after 3 consecutive runner-up finishes to Nadal, his main rival until 2010. At age 27, he surpassed Pete Sampras' record of 14 major men's singles titles at Wimbledon in 2009. Although Federer remained in the Top 3 during most of the early 2010s, the success of Djokovic and Nadal ended his dominance over grass and hard courts, winning two majors between 2010 and 2016. During this period of time, he and Stan Wawrinka led the Switzerland Davis Cup team to their first title in 2014, following their Olympic doubles gold victory at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Federer also won a silver medal in singles at the 2012 London Olympics, where he finished runner-up to Andy Murray. After a half-year hiatus in late 2016 to recover from knee surgery, Federer made a stellar return to tennis, winning three more majors over the next two years, including the 2017 Australian Open over Nadal and an eighth singles title at the 2017 Wimbledon Championships. At the 2018 Australian Open, Federer became the first man to win 20 major singles titles and shortly the oldest ATP world No. 1 at age 36. In September 2022, he retired from professional tennis following the Laver Cup. A versatile all-court player, Federer's perceived effortlessness has made him highly popular among tennis fans. Originally lacking self-control as a junior, he transformed his on-court demeanor to become well-liked for his general graciousness, winning the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award 13 times. He has won the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year award a record five times. Outside of competing, he played an instrumental role in the creation of the Laver Cup team competition. He is also an active philanthropist. He established the Roger Federer Foundation, which targets impoverished children in southern Africa, and has raised funds in part through the Match for Africa exhibition series. He is routinely one of the top ten highest-paid athletes in any sport and ranked first among all athletes with $100 million in endorsement income in 2020.","[['is', 'Swiss'], ['finished as', 'year end

30,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Marilyn_Manson,Marilyn Manson,"Brian Hugh Warner (born January 5, 1969), known professionally as Marilyn Manson, is an American rock musician. He came to prominence as the lead singer of the band which shares his name, of which he remains the only constant member since its formation in 1989. Known for his controversial stage personality and public image, his stage name (like the other founding members of the band) was formed by combining the names of two opposing American cultural icons: actress Marilyn Monroe and cult leader Charles Manson. Manson is best known for music released in the 1990s, including the albums Portrait of an American Family (1994), Antichrist Superstar (1996) and Mechanical Animals (1998), which earned him a reputation in mainstream media as a controversial figure and negative influence on young people when combined with his public image. In the U.S. alone, three of the band's albums have been awarded platinum status and three more went gold, and the band has had eight releases debut in the top 10, including two No. 1 albums. Manson has been ranked at No. 44 on the list of the ""Top 100 Heavy Metal Vocalists"" by Hit Parader and, along with his band, has been nominated for four Grammy Awards–Manson himself earned an additional Grammy nomination for his work on Kanye West's Donda. Manson made his film debut as an actor in David Lynch's Lost Highway (1997), and has since appeared in a variety of minor roles and cameos. In 2002, his first art show, The Golden Age of Grotesque, was held at the Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions center. He is widely considered one of the most controversial figures in heavy metal music, and has been involved in numerous controversies throughout his career. His lyrics were criticized by American politicians and were examined in congressional hearings. Several U.S. states enacted legislation specifically banning the group from performing in state-operated venues. In 1999, news media falsely blamed Manson for influencing the perpetrators of the Columbine High School massacre. His work has been cited in several other violent events; his paintings and films appeared as evidence in a murder trial, and he has been accused of inspiring several other murders and school shootings. In 2021, multiple women accused Manson of psychologically and sexually abusing them, allegations he denied.","[['is', 'American rock musician'], ['is', 'American'], ['is', 'rock musician'], ['only constant member since', 'its formation in 1989'], ['came to', 'prominence'], ['only member since', 'its formation'], ['remains', 'constant member'], ['constant member since', 'its formation in 1989'], ['remains', 'only member since its formation'], ['remains', 'constant member since its formation'], ['remains', 'member'], ['remains', 'only constant member since its formation'], ['only member since', 'its formation in 1989'], ['only constant member since', 'its formation'], ['came as', 'lead singer of band'], ['remains', 'only member since its formation in 1989'], ['remains', 'only member'], ['remains', 'only constant member'], ['member since', 'its formation'], ['remains', 'only constant member since its formation in 1989'], ['remains', 'member since its formation'], ['member since', 'its formation in 1989'], ['came as', 'lead singer'], ['remains', 'member since its formation in 1989'], ['remains', 'constant member since its formation in 1989'], ['constant member since', 'its formation'], ['is best known for', 'music released in 1990s'], ['is known for', 'music including albums Portrait of American Family 1994'], ['is known for', 'music released in 1990s including albums Portrait of American Family 1994'], ['is known for', 'music released in 1990s'], ['is best known for', 'music released in 1990s including albums Portrait of American Family 1994'], ['is known for', 'music released including albums Portrait'], ['is known for', 'music'], ['is known for', 'music released'], ['is', 'known'], ['is best known for', 'music including albums Portrait'], ['is known for', 'music released in 1990s including albums Portrait'], ['is best known for', 'music released'], ['is best known for', 'music released including albums Portrait'], ['is known for', 'music including albums Portrait'], ['is best known for', 'music released in 1990s including albums Portrait'], ['is known for', 'music released including albums Portrait of American Family 1994'], ['is best known for', 'music released including albums Portrait of American Family 1994'], ['is', 'best known'], ['is best known for', 'music'], ['is best known for', 'music including albums Portrait of American Family 1994'], ['has', 'has ranked on list of 100 Metal Vocalists by Hit Parader'], ['has', 'has ranked on list of 100 Heavy Metal Vocalists by Hit Parader'], ['has', 'has ranked on list of Top 100 Metal Vocalists by Hit Parader'], ['has', 'has ranked on list of Top 100 Heavy Metal Vocalists by Hit Parader'], ['has', 'has ranked at No. 44 by Hit Parader'], ['has', 'has ranked by Hit Parader'], ['has', 'has ranked at No. 44 on list by Hit Parader'], ['has', 'has ranked at No. 44 on list of 100 Heavy Metal Vocalists by Hit Parader'], ['has', 'has ranked at No. 44 on list of Top 100 Heavy Metal Vocalists by Hit Parader'], ['has', 'has ranked at No. 44 on list of 100 Metal Vocalists by Hit Parader'], ['has', 'has ranked at No. 44 on list of Top 100 Metal Vocalists by Hit Parader'], ['has', 'has ranked on list by Hit Parader'], ['made', 'his film debut'], ['show', 'Golden Age of Grotesque'], ['been involved throughout', 'his career'], ['been', 'involved in controversies throughout his career'], ['been', 'involved in numerous controversies throughout his career'], ['been involved in', 'numerous controversies'], ['been involved in', 'controversies'], ['is', 'considered'], ['is', 'widely considered'], ['been', 'involved'], ['has', 'has accused']]","[['type', 'American_rock_musician'], ['type', 'rock_musician'], ['onlySince', 'its_formation'], ['cameTo', 'prominence'], ['remains', 'constant_member'], ['remainsSince', 'only_member'], ['remainsSince', 'constant_member'], ['stillRemains', 'member'], ['remainsSince', 'only_constant_member'], ['consistedOf', 'lead_singer'], ['memberOf', 'band'], ['remains', 'only_member'], ['remains', 'only_constant_member'], ['remainsSince', 'member'], ['cameAs', 'lead_singer'], ['for', 'music'], ['schoolOf', 'music'], ['bestOf', 'albums'], ['portraitOf', 'Portrait'], ['portraitOf', 'American_Family'], ['bestOf', 'albums_Portrait'], ['releasedIncluding', 'music'], ['releasedIncluding', 'albums_Portrait'], ['albumsBy', 'list'], ['rankedBy', '100_Metal_Vocalists'], ['albumBy', 'Hit_Parader'], ['rankedBy', '100_Heavy_Metal_Vocalists'], ['rankedBy', 'Top_100_Metal_Vocalists'], ['rankedBy', 'Top_100_Heavy_Metal_Vocalists'], ['rankedBy', 'No'], ['by', '.'], ['made', 'film_debut'], ['showOf', 'Golden_Age'], ['ageOf', 'Grotesque'], ['involvedThroughout', 'his_career'], ['involvedThroughout', 'controversies'], ['involvedThroughout', 'numerous_controversies'], ['involvedIn', 'numerous_controversies'], ['involvedIn', 'controversies']]"

32,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/India,India,"India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country, and the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia. Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity. Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest. Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the Rigveda. Preserved by a resolutely vigilant oral tradition, the Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India. The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity, but also marked by the declining status of women, and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief. In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia. In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India's southern and western coasts.Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains,eventually founding the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.In the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,leaving a legacy of luminous architecture.Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty. British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly, but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of education and the public life took root. A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule. In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions, a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration. India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to 1.211 billion in 2011.During the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$1,498, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951,India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class. It has a space programme which includes several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.India is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,and rising levels of air pollution.India's land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots. Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area. India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India's culture, is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats.","[['is in', 'South Asia'], ['Republic of', 'India'], ['is', 'country'], ['is country in', 'South Asia'], ['is', 'country'], ['is seventh country by', 'area'], ['populous democracy in', 'world'], ['is country by', 'area'], ['most populous democracy in', 'world'], ['democracy in', 'world'], ['is', 'seventh country'], ['Bay of', 'Bengal'], ['shares land borders with', 'Pakistan'], ['Bay on', 'southeast'], ['shares land borders to', 'west'], ['shares', 'land borders'], ['is in', 'In Indian Ocean vicinity of Sri Lanka'], ['is in', 'In Indian Ocean vicinity'], ['is in', 'vicinity of Sri Lanka'], ['is in', 'vicinity'], ['been', 'federal'], ['has', 'has federal republic since 1950 governed through democratic parliamentary system'], ['has', 'has federal republic since 1950 governed through parliamentary system'], ['has', 'has republic'], ['has', 'has republic since 1950 governed through system'], ['has', 'has republic since 1950 governed'], ['has', 'has federal republic since 1950 governed through system'], ['has', 'has republic since 1950 governed through parliamentary system'], ['has', 'has federal republic'], ['has', 'has federal republic since 1950 governed'], ['has', 'has federal republic since 1950 governed through democratic system'], ['has', 'has republic since 1950 governed through democratic parliamentary system'], ['has', 'has republic since 1950 governed through democratic system'], ['is', 'society'], ['is', 'pluralistic'], ['is', 'pluralistic society'], ['has', 'population'], ['has become', 'major economy'], ['has become From', 'comparatively destitute country'], ['has become From', 'country'], ['has become with', 'expanding middle class'], ['has become', 'growing major economy'], ['has become', 'growing economy'], ['has become From', 'country in 1951'], ['has become From', 'destitute country in 1951'], ['has become with', 'expanding class'], ['has become From', 'destitute country'], ['has become', 'economy'], ['has become with', 'middle class'], ['has become with', 'class'], ['has become From', 'comparatively destitute country in 1951'], ['has', 'space programme'], ['has', 'disputes with its neighbours'], ['has', 'disputes'], ['has', 'disputes over Kashmir'], ['has', 'disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours'], ['has', 'wildlife'], ['in', 'culture']]","[['isIn', 'South_Asia'], ['stateOf', 'India'], ['isBy', 'area'], ['democracyIn', 'world'], ['type', 'seventh_country'], ['bordersWith', 'Pakistan'], ['indiaShares', 'west'], ['shares', 'land_borders'], ['isOf', 'Indian_Ocean_vicinity'], ['vicinityOf', 'Sri_Lanka'], ['isIn', 'Indian_Ocean_vicinity'], ['isOf', 'vicinity'], ['isIn', 'vicinity'], ['been', 'federal'], ['governedThrough', 'federal_republic'], ['governedThrough', 'democratic_parliamentary_system'], ['governedThrough', 'parliamentary_system'], ['has', 'republic'], ['governedThrough', 'republic'], ['governedThrough', 'system'], ['has', 'federal_republic'], ['governedThrough', 'democratic_system'], ['type', 'society'], ['type', 'pluralistic_society'], ['has', 'population'], ['become', 'major_economy'], ['isFrom', 'comparatively_destitute_country'], ['isFrom', 'country'], ['expanding', 'middle_class'], ['become', 'growing_major_economy'], ['become', 'growing_economy'], ['isFrom', 'destitute_country'], ['expanding', 'class'], ['become', 'economy'], ['isWith', 'middle_class'], ['isWith', 'class'], ['has', 'space_programme'], ['dealsWith', 'disputes'], ['disputesWith', 'its_neighbours'], ['has', 'disputes'], ['disputesOver', 'disputes'], ['disputesOver', 'Kashmir'], ['agreesWith', 'Kashmir'], ['has', 'wildlife'], ['indiaIn', 'culture']]"

From the 2002 French Open to the 2003 Australian Open, she was dominant, winning all four major singles titles (each time over Venus in the final) to achieve a non-calendar year Grand Slam and the career Grand Slam, known as the 'Serena Slam'. The next few years saw her claim two more singles majors, but suffer from injury and decline in form. Beginning in 2007, however, she gradually returned to form despite continued injuries, retaking the world No. 1 singles ranking. Beginning at the 2012 Wimbledon Championships, Williams returned to dominance, claiming Olympic gold and becoming the first tennis player to achieve a career Golden Slam in both singles and doubles. She won eight out of thirteen singles majors, including all four in a row from 2014–15 to achieve a second ""Serena Slam"". At the 2017 Australian Open, she won her 23rd major singles title, surpassing Steffi Graf's Open Era record. She then took a break from professional tennis after becoming pregnant and reached four major finals since returning to play. In August 2022, Williams announced her impending evolution away from professional tennis and played what was expected to be her final match at the 2022 US Open. Williams also won 14 major women's doubles titles, all with her sister Venus, and the pair was unbeaten in Grand Slam doubles finals. This includes a non-calendar year Grand Slam between the 2009 Wimbledon Championships and the 2010 French Open, which granted the sisters the doubles world No. 1 ranking. She won four Olympic gold medals, three in women's doubles—an all-time joint record shared with her sister. She has also won two major mixed doubles titles, both in 1998. The arrival of the Williams sisters has been credited with ushering in a new era of power and athleticism on the women's professional tennis tour. Serena holds the most combined major titles in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles among active players, with 39: 23 in singles, 14 in women's doubles, and two in mixed doubles. She is joint-third on the all-time list and second in the Open Era for total major titles. She is the most recent woman to simultaneously hold all four major singles titles (2002–03 and 2014–15), and the most recent woman to win the Surface Slam (major titles on hard, clay and grass courts in the same calendar year), doing so in 2015. She is also, with Venus, the most recent player to have simultaneously held all four major women's doubles titles (2009–10). Williams was the world's highest paid woman athlete in 2016, earning almost $29 million. She repeated this feat in 2017 when she was the only woman on Forbes' list of the 100 highest-paid athletes, with $27 million in prize money and endorsements. She has won the Laureus Sportswoman of the Year award four times (2003, 2010, 2016, 2018), and in December 2015 was named Sportsperson of the Year by Sports Illustrated magazine. In 2021, she was ranked 28th on Forbes' World's Highest-Paid Athletes list. She is the highest-earning woman athlete of all time.","[['is', 'American'], ['is', 'inactive'], ['is', 'professional'], ['finished as', 'year end No. 1 five times'], ['won', 'the by player in Open

34,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Novak_Djokovic,Novak Djokovic,"Novak Djokovic (Serbian Cyrillic: Новак Ђоковић, romanized: Novak Đoković, pronounced [nôʋaːk dʑôːkoʋitɕ]; born 22 May 1987) is a Serbian professional tennis player. He has been ranked world No. 1 for a record total 373 weeks, and has finished as the year-end No. 1 a record seven times. He has won 21 Grand Slam men's singles titles, including a record nine Australian Open titles. He is currently ranked world No. 5 in singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). Overall, he has won 91 ATP singles titles, which include a record 65 Big Titles, a joint-record six year-end championships, and a record 38 Masters titles. Djokovic has completed a non-calendar year Grand Slam in singles, becoming the only man in tennis history to be the reigning champion of the four majors at once across three different surfaces. He is also the first man in the Open Era to achieve a double Career Grand Slam in singles and the only player to complete the Career Golden Masters in singles on the ATP Tour, which he has done twice. Djokovic began his professional career in 2003. At age 20, he disrupted Roger Federer's and Rafael Nadal's streak of 11 consecutive majors to win his first major title at the 2008 Australian Open. By 2010, Djokovic also separated himself from the rest of the field to join Federer and Nadal in the Big Three, collectively considered by some to be the three most successful male tennis players of all time. In 2011, Djokovic ascended to No. 1 for the first time, winning three out of the four majors and five Masters titles. He remained the most successful player in men's tennis for the rest of the decade. In 2015, Djokovic had his most successful season, reaching 15 consecutive finals and winning a season-record 10 Big Titles. His dominant run extended through to the 2016 French Open, where he completed a non-calendar year Grand Slam and his first career Grand Slam, becoming the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four majors simultaneously and setting a ranking points record (16,950). Representing Serbia, Djokovic led the Serbian national team to their first Davis Cup title in 2010 and to the inaugural ATP Cup title in 2020. Moreover, he won the bronze medal for Serbia at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Djokovic has won the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year award four times (2012, 2015, 2016, 2019), the BBC Sports Personality World Sport Star of the Year award in 2011 and the L'Équipe Champion of Champions award in 2021. He is also a recipient of the Order of St. Sava, the Order of Karađorđe's Star, and the Order of the Republika Srpska. Beyond competition, Djokovic is an active philanthropist and a former ATP player council president. In August 2020, Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil announced the formation of the Professional Tennis Players Association as the first player-only association in tennis, citing the need for players to have more influence on the tour and advocating better prize money structure for lower ranked players.","[['is', 'professional'], ['is', 'Serbian'], ['finished as', 'year end No. 1 record seven times'],

35,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/China,China,"China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a country in East Asia. It is the world's most populous country, with a population exceeding 1.4 billion, slightly ahead of India. China spans the equivalent of five time zones and borders fourteen countries by land, the most of any country in the world, tied with Russia. China also has a narrow maritime boundary with the disputed Taiwan. Covering an area of approximately 9.6 million square kilometers (3,700,000 sq mi), it is the world's third largest country by total land area. The country consists of 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four municipalities, and two Special Administrative Regions (Hong Kong and Macau). The national capital is Beijing, and the most populous city and financial center is Shanghai. Modern Chinese trace their origins to a cradle of civilization in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. The semi-legendary Xia dynasty in the 21st century BCE and the well-attested Shang and Zhou dynasties developed a bureaucratic political system to serve hereditary monarchies, or dynasties. Chinese writing, Chinese classic literature, and the Hundred Schools of Thought emerged during this period and influenced China and its neighbors for centuries to come. In the third century BCE, Qin's wars of unification created the first Chinese empire, the short-lived Qin dynasty. The Qin was followed by the more stable Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), which established a model for nearly two millennia in which the Chinese empire was one of the world's foremost economic powers. The empire expanded, fractured and re-unified, was conquered and reestablished, absorbed foreign religions and ideas, and made world-leading scientific advances, such as the Four Great Inventions: gunpowder, paper, the compass, and printing. After centuries of disunion following the fall of the Han, the Sui (581–618) and Tang (618–907) dynasties reunified the empire. The multi-ethnic Tang welcomed foreign trade and culture that came over the Silk Road and adapted Buddhism to Chinese needs. The early modern Song dynasty (960–1279) became increasingly urban and commercial. The civilian scholar-official or literati used the examination system and the doctrines of Neo-Confucianism to replace the military aristocrats of earlier dynasties. The Mongol invasion established the Yuan dynasty in 1279, but the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) re-established Han Chinese control. The Manchu-led Qing dynasty nearly doubled the empire's territory and established a multi-ethnic state that was the basis of the modern Chinese nation, but suffered heavy losses to foreign imperialism in the 19th century. The Chinese monarchy collapsed in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution, when the Republic of China (ROC) replaced the Qing dynasty. In its early years as a republic, the country underwent a period of instability known as the Warlord Era before mostly reunifying in 1928 under a Nationalist government. A civil war between the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) began in 1927. Japan invaded China in 1937, starting the Second Sino-Japanese War and temporarily halting the civil war. The surrender and expulsion of Japanese forces from China in 1945 left a power vacuum in the country, which led to renewed fighting between the CCP and the Kuomintang. The civil war ended in 1949 with the division of Chinese territory; the CCP established the People's Republic of China on the mainland while the Kuomintang-led ROC government retreated to the island of Taiwan. Both claim to be the sole legitimate government of China, although the United Nations has recognized the PRC as the sole representation since 1971. From 1959 to 1961, the PRC implemented an economic and social campaign called the Great Leap Forward, that resulted in a sharp economic decline and an estimated 15 to 55 million deaths, mostly through man-made famine. From 1966 to 1976, the turbulent period of political and social chaos within China known as the Cultural Revolution led to greater economic and educational decline, with millions being purged or subjected to either persecution or politicide based on political categories. Since then, the Chinese government has rebuked some of the earlier Maoist policies, conducting a series of political and economic reforms since 1978, which has greatly raised Chinese standards of living, and increased life expectancies. China is currently governed as a unitary Marxist–Leninist one-party socialist republic by the CCP. China is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and a founding member of several multilateral and regional cooperation organizations such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Silk Road Fund, the New Development Bank, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the RCEP, and is a member of the BRICS, the G8+5, the G20, the APEC, and the East Asia Summit. It ranks among the lowest in measurements of civil liberties, government transparency, freedom of the press, freedom of religion and ethnic minorities. The Chinese authorities have been criticized by human rights activists and non-governmental organizations for human rights abuses, including political repression, mass censorship, mass surveillance of their citizens, and violent suppression of protests. Making up around one-fifth of the world economy, China is the world's largest economy by GDP by purchasing power parity, the second-largest economy by nominal GDP, and the second-wealthiest country. The country is one of the fastest growing major economies and is the world's largest manufacturer and exporter. China is a recognized nuclear-weapon state with the world's largest standing army by military personnel and second-largest defense budget. China is considered to be a potential superpower due to its large markets, high innovation, economic potential, growing military strength, and influence in international affairs.","[[""'s Republic

36,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/France,France,"France (French: [fʁɑ̃s] ), officially the French Republic (French: République française [ʁepyblik frɑ̃sɛz]), is a transcontinental country predominantly located in Western Europe and spanning overseas regions and territories in the Americas and the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. Its metropolitan area extends from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea; overseas territories include French Guiana in South America, Saint Pierre and Miquelon in the North Atlantic, the French West Indies, and many islands in Oceania and the Indian Ocean. Due to its several coastal territories, France has the largest exclusive economic zone in the world. France borders Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Monaco, Italy, Andorra, and Spain in continental Europe, as well as the Netherlands, Suriname, and Brazil in the Americas via its overseas territories in French Guiana and Saint Martin. Its eighteen integral regions (five of which are overseas) span a combined area of 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi) and contain close to 68 million people (as of July 2022). France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre; other major urban areas include Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, Lille, Bordeaux, and Nice. Inhabited since the Palaeolithic era, the territory of Metropolitan France was settled by Celtic tribes known as Gauls during the Iron Age. Rome annexed the area in 51 BC, leading to a distinct Gallo-Roman culture that laid the foundation of the French language. The Germanic Franks formed the Kingdom of Francia, which became the heartland of the Carolingian Empire. The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned the empire, with West Francia becoming the Kingdom of France in 987. In the High Middle Ages, France was a powerful but highly decentralised feudal kingdom. Philip II successfully strengthened royal power and defeated his rivals to double the size of the crown lands; by the end of his reign, France had emerged as the most powerful state in Europe. From the mid-14th to the mid-15th century, France was plunged into a series of dynastic conflicts involving England, collectively known as the Hundred Years' War, and a distinct French identity emerged as a result. The French Renaissance saw art and culture flourish, conflict with the House of Habsburg, and the establishment of a global colonial empire, which by the 20th century would become the second-largest in the world. The second half of the 16th century was dominated by religious civil wars between Catholics and Huguenots that severely weakened the country. France again emerged as Europe's dominant power in the 17th century under Louis XIV following the Thirty Years' War. Inadequate economic policies, inequitable taxes and frequent wars (notably a defeat in the Seven Years' War and costly involvement in the American War of Independence) left the kingdom in a precarious economic situation by the end of the 18th century. This precipitated the French Revolution of 1789, which overthrew the Ancien Régime and produced the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which expresses the nation's ideals to this day. France reached its political and military zenith in the early 19th century under Napoleon Bonaparte, subjugating much of continental Europe and establishing the First French Empire. The French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars shaped the course of European and world history. The collapse of the empire initiated a period of relative decline, in which France endured a tumultuous succession of governments until the founding of the French Third Republic during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. Subsequent decades saw a period of optimism, cultural and scientific flourishing, as well as economic prosperity, known as the Belle Époque. France was one of the major participants of World War I, from which it emerged victorious at a great human and economic cost. It was among the Allied powers of World War II but was soon occupied by the Axis in 1940. Following liberation in 1944, the short-lived Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the Algerian War. The current Fifth Republic was formed in 1958 by Charles de Gaulle. Algeria and most French colonies became independent in the 1960s, with the majority retaining close economic and military ties with France. France retains its centuries-long status as a global centre of art, science and philosophy. It hosts the fifth-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is the world's leading tourist destination, receiving over 89 million foreign visitors in 2018. France is a developed country with the world's seventh-largest economy by nominal GDP and tenth-largest by PPP; in terms of aggregate household wealth, it ranks fourth in the world. France performs well in international rankings of education, health care, life expectancy and human development. It remains a great power in global affairs, being one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and an official nuclear-weapon state. France is a founding and leading member of the European Union and the Eurozone, as well as a key member of the Group of Seven, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Francophonie.","[['is', 'transcontinental'], ['is', 'transcontinental country'], ['is', 'country'], ['has zone Due', 'its several territories'], ['has zone

37,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Michael_Jackson,Michael Jackson,"Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist. Dubbed the ""King of Pop"", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson influenced artists across many music genres; through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, as well as the robot. He is the most awarded musician in history. The eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his public debut in 1964 with his older brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records. He became a solo star with his 1979 album Off the Wall. His music videos, including those for ""Beat It"", ""Billie Jean"", and ""Thriller"" from his 1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an artform and promotional tool. He helped propel the success of MTV and continued to innovate with videos for the albums Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995), and Invincible (2001). Thriller became the best-selling album of all time, while Bad was the first album to produce five U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles. From the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to his changing appearance, relationships, behavior, and lifestyle. In 1993, he was accused of sexually abusing the child of a family friend. The lawsuit was settled out of civil court; Jackson was not indicted due to lack of evidence. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. The FBI found no evidence of criminal conduct on Jackson's behalf in either case. In 2009, while he was preparing for a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, Jackson died from an overdose of propofol administered by his personal physician, Conrad Murray, who was convicted in 2011 of involuntary manslaughter. His death triggered reactions around the world, creating unprecedented surges of Internet traffic and a spike in sales of his music. A televised memorial service to Jackson, held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, was viewed by an estimated over 2.5 billion people globally. Jackson is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 400 million records worldwide. He had 13 Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles (more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era) and was the first artist to have a top-ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades. He is regarded by the RIAA as the highest-selling individual music artist of all time worldwide. His honors include 15 Grammy Awards, 6 Brit Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and 39 Guinness World Records, including the ""Most Successful Entertainer of All Time"". Jackson's inductions include the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (twice), the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Dance Hall of Fame (the only recording artist to be inducted), and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame.","[['was', 'American'], ['Dubbed', 'King'], ['Dubbed', 'King of Pop'], ['is', 'regarded'], ['influenced artists across', 'music genres'], ['influenced artists across', 'many music genres'], ['influenced across', 'music genres'], ['influenced across', 'many music genres'], ['popularized', 'complicated dance moves'], ['popularized', 'dance moves'], ['gave', 'name'], ['popularized dance moves through', 'stage'], ['is musician in', 'history'], ['is', 'awarded musician'], ['is', 'most awarded musician'], ['is', 'musician'], ['is awarded musician in', 'history'], ['is most awarded musician in', 'history'], ['made', 'his debut'], ['made', 'his public debut'], ['began', 'his solo career'], ['became with', 'his 1979 album'], ['became with', 'his 1979 album Off Wall'], ['became', 'solo star'], ['became due', 'his appearance'], ['became due', 'his changing appearance'], ['became', 'figure'], ['figure of', 'controversy'], ['became From', '1980s'], ['became', 'figure of controversy'], ['became From', 'late 1980s'], ['was', 'accused'], ['was accused In', '1993'], ['was tried of', 'child abuse allegations'], ['was', 'In 2005 tried of child sexual abuse allegations'], ['was', 'tried'], ['was tried of', 'further child sexual abuse allegations'], ['was tried of', 'child sexual abuse allegations'], ['was tried In', '2005'], ['was tried of', 'further child abuse allegations'], ['was', 'In 2005 tried of further child abuse allegations'], ['was', 'In 2005 tried of child abuse allegations'], ['was', 'In 2005 tried of further child sexual abuse allegations'], ['died from', 'overdose of propofol administered by his physician'], ['died from', 'overdose administered'], ['died from', 'overdose administered by his personal physician'], ['died from', 'overdose administered by his physician'], ['died from', 'overdose of propofol administered by his personal physician'], ['died from', 'overdose of propofol'], ['died from', 'overdose of propofol administered'], ['died from', 'overdose'], ['is', 'regarded by RIAA as individual music artist of time worldwide'], ['is', 'regarded by RIAA as highest selling individual music artist of time worldwide'], ['is', 'regarded by RIAA as selling music artist of time worldwide'], ['is regarded by', 'RIAA'], ['is', 'regarded by RIAA as selling individual music artist of time worldwide'], ['is', 'regarded by RIAA as highest selling music artist of time worldwide'], ['is', 'regarded by RIAA as music artist of time worldwide'], ['has', 'inductions']]","[['dubbed', 'King'], ['kingOf', 'King'], ['kingOf', 'Pop'], ['influencedAcross', 'music_genres'], ['influencedAcross', 'many_music_genres'], ['popularized', 'complicated_dance_moves'], ['popularized', 'dance_moves'], ['gave', 'name'], ['dancedThrough', 'stage'], ['musicianIn', 'history'], ['isAwarded', 'musician'], ['isAwarded', 'most_awarded_musician'], ['type', 'musician'], ['made', 'debut'], ['made', 'public_debut'], ['began', 'solo_career'], ['becameWith', 'his_1979_album'], ['theAlbum', 'his_1979_album'], ['album', 'Off_Wall'], ['became', 'solo_star'], ['becameBecame', 'his_appearance'], ['becameBecame', 'his_changing_appearance'], ['became', 'figure'], ['figureOf', 'controversy'], ['becameOf', 'figure'], ['becameFrom', 'late_1980s'], ['convictedOf', 'child_abuse_allegations'], ['diedOf', 'child_sexual_abuse_allegations'], ['acquittedOf', 'further_child_sexual_abuse_allegations'], ['acquittedOf', 'further_child_abuse_allegations'], ['diedBy', 'overdose'], ['diedBy', 'propofol'], ['diedBy', 'his_physician'], ['diedBy', 'his_personal_physician'], ['diedOf', 'overdose'], ['diedOf', 'propofol'], ['presidentOf', 'RIAA'], ['listOf', 'individual_music_artist'], ['artistOf', 'time'], ['isOf', 'highest_selling_individual_music_artist'], ['sonOf', 'music_artist'], ['regardedBy', 'RIAA'], ['sonOf', 'highest_selling_music_artist'], ['has', 'inductions']]"

39,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Johnny_Depp,Johnny Depp,"John Christopher Depp II (born June 9, 1963) is an American actor and musician. He is the recipient of multiple accolades, including a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award, in addition to nominations for three Academy Awards and two BAFTA awards. Depp made his feature film debut in the horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) and appeared in Platoon (1986), before rising to prominence as a teen idol on the television series 21 Jump Street (1987–1990). In the 1990s, Depp acted mostly in independent films with auteur directors, often playing eccentric characters. These included Cry-Baby (1990), What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), Benny and Joon (1993), Dead Man (1995), Donnie Brasco (1997), and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998). Depp also began his longtime collaboration with director Tim Burton, portraying the leads in the films Edward Scissorhands (1990), Ed Wood (1994), and Sleepy Hollow (1999). In the 2000s, Depp became one of the most commercially successful film stars by playing Captain Jack Sparrow in the Walt Disney swashbuckler film series Pirates of the Caribbean (2003–2017). He also received critical praise for Chocolat (2000), Finding Neverland (2004) and Public Enemies (2009), while also continuing his commercially successful collaboration with Tim Burton with the films Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), where he portrayed Willy Wonka, Corpse Bride (2005), Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), and Alice in Wonderland (2010). In 2012, Depp was one of the world's biggest film stars, and was listed by the Guinness World Records as the world's highest-paid actor, with earnings of US$75 million in a year. During the 2010s Depp began producing films through his company Infinitum Nihil. He also received critical praise for Black Mass (2015) and formed the rock supergroup Hollywood Vampires with Alice Cooper and Joe Perry, before starring as Gellert Grindelwald in the Wizarding World films Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016), and Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (2018). Between 1998 and 2012, Depp was in a relationship with French singer Vanessa Paradis and together they had two children, including actress Lily-Rose Depp. From 2015 to 2017, Depp was married to actress Amber Heard. Their divorce drew much media attention as both alleged abuse against each other. In 2018, Depp unsuccessfully sued the publishers of British tabloid The Sun for defamation under English law; a judge ruled the publication labelling him a ""wife beater"" was ""substantially true"". Depp later successfully sued Heard in a 2022 trial in Virginia; a seven-member jury ruled that Heard's allegations of ""sexual violence"" and ""domestic abuse"" were false and defamed Depp under American law.","[['is', 'American'], ['is recipient of', 'accolades including Golden Globe Award'], ['is recipient of', 'multiple accolades including Golden Globe Award'], ['is recipient of',

40,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/South_Africa,South Africa,"South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded to the south by 2,798 kilometres (1,739 mi) of coastline that stretch along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans; to the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe; and to the east and northeast by Mozambique and Eswatini. It also completely enclaves the country Lesotho. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World, and the second-most populous country located entirely south of the equator, after Tanzania. South Africa is a biodiversity hotspot, with unique biomes, plant and animal life. With over 60 million people, the country is the world's 24th-most populous nation and covers an area of 1,221,037 square kilometres (471,445 square miles). South Africa has three capital cities, with the executive, judicial and legislative branches of government based in Pretoria, Bloemfontein, and Cape Town respectively. The largest city is Johannesburg. About 80% of the population are Black South Africans. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (White South Africans), Asian (Indian South Africans and Chinese South Africans), and multiracial (Coloured South Africans) ancestry. South Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures, languages, and religions. Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution's recognition of 11 official languages, the fourth-highest number in the world. According to the 2011 census, the two most spoken first languages are Zulu (22.7%) and Xhosa (16.0%). The two next ones are of European origin: Afrikaans (13.5%) developed from Dutch and serves as the first language of most Coloured and White South Africans; English (9.6%) reflects the legacy of British colonialism and is commonly used in public and commercial life. The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a coup d'état, and regular elections have been held for almost a century. However, the vast majority of Black South Africans were not enfranchised until 1994. During the 20th century, the black majority sought to claim more rights from the dominant white minority, which played a large role in the country's recent history and politics. The National Party imposed apartheid in 1948, institutionalising previous racial segregation. After a long and sometimes violent struggle by the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid activists both inside and outside the country, the repeal of discriminatory laws began in the mid-1980s. Since 1994, all ethnic and linguistic groups have held political representation in the country's liberal democracy, which comprises a parliamentary republic and nine provinces. South Africa is often referred to as the ""rainbow nation"" to describe the country's multicultural diversity, especially in the wake of apartheid. South Africa is a middle power in international affairs; it maintains significant regional influence and is a member of both the Commonwealth of Nations and the G20. It is a developing country, ranking 109th on the Human Development Index, the 2nd highest in Africa. It has been classified by the World Bank as a newly industrialised country and has the third-largest economy in Africa and the most industrialized, technologically advanced economy in Africa overall as well as the 33rd-largest in the world. South Africa has the most UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Africa. Since the end of apartheid, government accountability and quality of life have substantially improved. However, crime, poverty and inequality remain widespread, with about two-fifths of the total population being unemployed as of 2021, while some three-fifths of the population lived under the poverty line in 2014 and a quarter under $2.15 a day.","[['is country in', 'Africa'], ['Republic of', 'South Africa'], ['is southernmost country in', 'Africa'], ['is', 'country'], ['is', 'southernmost

45,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/New_Zealand,New Zealand,"New Zealand (Māori: Aotearoa [aɔˈtɛaɾɔa]) is an island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. It consists of two main landmasses—the North Island (Te Ika-a-Māui) and the South Island (Te Waipounamu)—and over 700 smaller islands. It is the sixth-largest island country by area, covering 268,021 square kilometres (103,500 sq mi). New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometres (600 mi) south of the islands of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. The country's varied topography and sharp mountain peaks, including the Southern Alps, owe much to tectonic uplift and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, and its most populous city is Auckland. The islands of New Zealand were the last large habitable land to be settled by humans. Between about 1280 and 1350, Polynesians began to settle in the islands and then developed a distinctive Māori culture. In 1642, the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight and record New Zealand. In 1840, representatives of the United Kingdom and Māori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi, which in its English version declared British sovereignty over the islands. In 1841, New Zealand became a colony within the British Empire. Subsequently, a series of conflicts between the colonial government and Māori tribes resulted in the alienation and confiscation of large amounts of Māori land. New Zealand became a dominion in 1907; it gained full statutory independence in 1947, retaining the monarch as head of state. Today, the majority of New Zealand's population of 5.1 million is of European descent; the indigenous Māori are the largest minority, followed by Asians and Pacific Islanders. Reflecting this, New Zealand's culture is mainly derived from Māori and early British settlers, with recent broadening of culture arising from increased immigration. The official languages are English, Māori, and New Zealand Sign Language, with the local dialect of English being dominant. A developed country, New Zealand ranks highly in international comparisons of national performance, such as quality of life, education, protection of civil liberties, government transparency, and economic freedom. The country was the first to introduce a minimum wage, and the first to give women the right to vote. New Zealand underwent major economic changes during the 1980s, which transformed it from a protectionist to a liberalised free-trade economy. The service sector dominates the national economy, followed by the industrial sector, and agriculture; international tourism is also a significant source of revenue. Nationally, legislative authority is vested in an elected, unicameral Parliament, while executive political power is exercised by the Cabinet, led by the prime minister, currently Jacinda Ardern. King Charles III is the country's monarch and is represented by the governor-general. In addition, New Zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government purposes. The Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau (a dependent territory); the Cook Islands and Niue (self-governing states in free association with New Zealand); and the Ross Dependency, which is New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica.

In his early career, Baldwin played both leading and supporting roles in a variety of films such as Tim Burton's Beetlejuice (1988), Mike Nichols' Working Girl (1988), Jonathan Demme's Married to the Mob (1988), and Oliver Stone's Talk Radio (1988). He gained attention for his performances as Jack Ryan in The Hunt for Red October (1990) and in Glengarry Glen Ross (1992). Since then he has worked with directors such as Woody Allen in Alice (1990), To Rome with Love (2012) and Blue Jasmine (2013), and Martin Scorsese in The Aviator (2004) and The Departed (2006). His performance in the drama The Cooler (2003) garnered him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He has done voice work for The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (2004), Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa (2008), Rise of the Guardians (2012), and The Boss Baby film franchise (2017–present). From 2006 to 2013, Baldwin received critical acclaim starring alongside Tina Fey as Jack Donaghy on the NBC sitcom 30 Rock, winning two Primetime Emmy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and seven Screen Actors Guild Awards for his work on the series, making him the male performer with the most SAG Awards in history. On stage, he portrayed Stanley Kowalski in the 1992 Broadway production of A Streetcar Named Desire and the title character in a 1998 Off-Broadway production of Macbeth, the former earning him a Tony Award nomination. Baldwin co-starred in Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (2015) and Mission: Impossible – Fallout (2018), the fifth and sixth installments of the Mission: Impossible series. He is also a columnist for The Huffington Post. He also was the host of Match Game from 2016 until 2021. Baldwin has received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Donald Trump on the long-running sketch series Saturday Night Live, both during the latter part of the 2016 presidential election campaign and following the inauguration, a role that won him his third Primetime Emmy in 2017. He was nominated again in 2018 and 2021. In 2021, while on the Rust film set, Baldwin discharged a revolver used as a prop, which killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injured director Joel Souza.","[['is', 'American'], ['played roles

50,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Frank_Sinatra,Frank Sinatra,"Francis Albert Sinatra (/sɪˈnɑːtrə/; December 12, 1915 – May 14, 1998) was an American singer and actor. Nicknamed the ""Chairman of the Board"" and later called ""Ol' Blue Eyes"", Sinatra was one of the most popular entertainers of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. He is among the world's best-selling music artists with an estimated 150 million record sales. Born to Italian immigrants in Hoboken, New Jersey, Sinatra was greatly influenced by the intimate, easy-listening vocal style of Bing Crosby and began his musical career in the swing era with bandleaders Harry James and Tommy Dorsey. He found success as a solo artist after signing with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the ""bobby soxers"". Sinatra released his debut album, The Voice of Frank Sinatra, in 1946. When his film career stalled in the early 1950s, Sinatra turned to Las Vegas, where he became one of its best-known residency performers and part of the famous Rat Pack. His acting career was revived by the 1953 film From Here to Eternity, which earned Sinatra an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Sinatra then signed with Capitol Records and released several critically lauded albums, some of which were later considered as among the first ""concept albums"", including In the Wee Small Hours (1955), Songs for Swingin' Lovers! (1956), Come Fly with Me (1958), Only the Lonely (1958), No One Cares (1959), and Nice 'n' Easy (1960). Sinatra left Capitol in 1960 to start his own record label, Reprise Records and released a string of successful albums. In 1965, he recorded the retrospective album September of My Years and starred in the Emmy-winning television special Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music. After releasing Sinatra at the Sands, recorded at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Vegas with frequent collaborator Count Basie in early 1966, the following year he recorded one of his most famous collaborations with Tom Jobim, the album Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim. It was followed by 1968's Francis A. & Edward K. with Duke Ellington. Sinatra retired for the first time in 1971, but came out of retirement two years later. He recorded several albums and resumed performing at Caesars Palace, and released ""New York, New York"" in 1980. Using his Las Vegas shows as a home base, he toured within the United States and internationally until shortly before his death in 1998. Sinatra forged a highly successful career as a film actor. After winning an Academy Award for best supporting actor in From Here to Eternity, he starred in The Man with the Golden Arm (1955) and The Manchurian Candidate (1962). Sinatra also appeared in musicals such as On the Town (1949), Guys and Dolls (1955), High Society (1956), and Pal Joey (1957), which won him another Golden Globe. Toward the end of his career, he frequently played detectives, including the title character in Tony Rome (1967). Sinatra received the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1971. On television, The Frank Sinatra Show began on CBS in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s. While Sinatra never learned how to read music, he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music. A perfectionist, renowned for his style and presence, Sinatra always insisted on recording live with his band. He led a colorful personal life and was involved in turbulent relationships, including his second marriage to Ava Gardner. He later married Mia Farrow in 1966 and Barbara Marx in 1976. Sinatra had several violent confrontations, often with journalists he felt had crossed him or work bosses with whom he had disagreements. He was deeply involved with politics starting in the mid-1940s and actively campaigned for presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. Sinatra was investigated by the FBI for his alleged relationship with the mafia. Sinatra was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1983, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. He received eleven Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Sinatra was included in Time magazine's compilation of the 20th century's 100 most influential people. After Sinatra's death, American music critic Robert Christgau called him ""the greatest singer of the 20th century"" and he continues to be regarded as an iconic figure.","[['was', 'American singer'], ['was', 'singer'], ['was', 'American'], ['is among', ""world 's music artists with estimated 150 million record sales""], ['is among', ""world 's best selling music artists with 150 million record sales""], ['is among', ""world 's best selling music artists with estimated 150 million record sales""], ['is among', ""world 's music artists""], ['is among', ""world 's selling music artists with 150 million record sales""], ['is among', ""world 's music artists with 150 million record sales""], ['is among', ""world 's selling music artists""], ['is among', ""world 's best selling music artists""], ['is among', ""world 's selling music artists with estimated 150 million record sales""], ['found success after', 'signing with Columbia Records in 1943'], ['found success after', 'signing in 1943'], ['found success after', 'signing'], ['found success after', 'signing becoming'], ['found success after', 'signing with Columbia Records in 1943 becoming'], ['found success after', 'signing with Columbia Records'], ['found success after', 'signing with Columbia Records becoming'], ['found success as', 'solo artist'], ['found success after', 'signing in 1943 becoming'], ['found', 'success'], ['released', 'his debut album'], ['released', 'Voice'], ['album', 'Voice of Frank Sinatra'], ['released', 'Voice of Frank Sinatra'], ['became', 'one its residency performers'], ['became', 'one its known residency performers'], ['became', 'one of its residency performers'], ['became', 'one its best known residency performers'], ['turned to', 'Las Vegas'], ['became', 'one of its known residency performers'], ['became', 'one of its best known residency performers'], ['released', 'several albums'], ['released', 'critically lauded albums'], ['released', 'several critically lauded albums'], ['released', 'albums'], ['released', 'several lauded albums'], ['signed with', 'Capitol Records'], ['released', 'lauded albums'], ['start', 'his own record label'], ['label', 'Reprise Records'], ['left Capitol in', '1960'], ['start', 'Reprise Records'], ['left', 'Capitol'], ['start', 'his record label'], ['starred in', 'television'], ['recorded', 'album September'], ['recorded', 'retrospective album September of My Years'], ['recorded', 'album September of My Years'], ['starred in', 'winning television'], ['recorded', 'retrospective album September'], ['starred in', 'Emmy winning television'], ['was', 'followed'], ['was', 'followed by'], ['recorded', 'several albums'], ['released New York in', '1980'], ['resumed', 'performing'], ['released', 'New York'], ['released', 'New York'], ['recorded', 'albums'], ['resumed', 'performing at Caesars Palace'], ['toured within', 'United States'], ['forged', 'career'], ['forged', 'successful career'], ['forged career as', 'film actor'], ['forged', 'highly successful career'], ['starred in', 'Man'], ['winning', 'Academy Award for actor'], ['winning Academy Award in', 'in Here'], ['starred in', 'Man with Golden Arm'], ['winning', 'Academy Award for supporting actor'], ['winning', 'Academy Award for best actor'], ['winning', 'Academy Award'], ['winning Academy Award to', 'Eternity'], ['winning', 'Academy Award for best supporting actor'], ['also appeared in', 'musicals'], ['appeared in', 'musicals'], ['played detectives Toward', 'end of his career'], ['frequently played', 'detectives including title character'], ['frequently played detectives Toward', 'end of his career'], ['frequently played', 'detectives'], ['played detectives Toward', 'end'], ['played', 'detectives including title character'], ['frequently played detectives Toward', 'end'], ['played', 'detectives'], ['frequently played', 'detectives including title character in Tony Rome'], ['played', 'detectives including title character in Tony Rome'], ['received', 'Golden Globe Cecil B.

She soon established herself in Hollywood with appearances in films such as Desperado (1995), From Dusk till Dawn (1996), Wild Wild West (1999), and Dogma (1999). Hayek's portrayal of painter Frida Kahlo in the biographical film Frida (2002), which she also produced, made her the first Mexican actress to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress and additionally earned her Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award and British Academy Film Award nominations. In subsequent years, Hayek focused more on producing while starring in the action-centered pictures Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003), After the Sunset (2004) and Bandidas (2006).

His fame dates back to 1992 when he featured on Dr. Dre's debut solo single, ""Deep Cover"", and then on Dre's debut solo album, The Chronic. Broadus has since sold over 23 million albums in the United States and 35 million albums worldwide. His accolades include an American Music Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, and 17 nominations at the Grammy Awards. Broadus' debut solo album, Doggystyle, produced by Dr. Dre, was released by Death Row Records in November 1993, and debuted at number one on the popular albums chart, the Billboard 200, and on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Selling 800,000 copies in its first week, Doggystyle was certified quadruple-platinum in 1994 and featured the singles ""What's My Name?"" and ""Gin and Juice"". In 1994, Death Row Records released a soundtrack, by Broadus, for the short film Murder Was the Case, starring Snoop. In 1996, his second album, Tha Doggfather, also debuted at number one on both charts, with ""Snoop's Upside Ya Head"" as the lead single. The next year, the album was certified double-platinum. After leaving Death Row Records in January 1998, Broadus signed with No Limit Records, releasing three Snoop albums: Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told (1998), No Limit Top Dogg (1999), and Tha Last Meal (2000). In 2002, he signed with Priority/Capitol/EMI Records, releasing Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss. In 2004, he signed to Geffen Records, releasing his next three albums: R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece, then Tha Blue Carpet Treatment, and Ego Trippin'.

The winner of the Miss World 2000 pageant, Chopra is one of India's highest-paid actresses and has received numerous accolades, including two National Film Award and five Filmfare Awards. In 2016, the Government of India honoured her with the Padma Shri, and Time named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world, and in the next two years, Forbes listed her among the World's 100 Most Powerful Women. Chopra initially aspired to study aeronautical engineering but accepted offers to join the Indian film industry, opportunities that arose as a result of her pageant wins. Her acting debut came in the Tamil film Thamizhan (2002), followed by her first Bollywood feature in The Hero: Love Story of a Spy (2003). She played the leading lady in the box-office hits Andaaz (2003) and Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004) and had her breakout role in the 2004 romantic thriller Aitraaz. Chopra established herself with starring roles in the top-grossing productions Krrish and Don (both 2006), and reprised her role in their sequels. For playing a troubled model in the drama Fashion (2008), Chopra won a National Film Award and a Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Chopra gained further praise for portraying a range of characters in the films Kaminey (2009), 7 Khoon Maaf (2011), Barfi! (2012), Mary Kom (2014), and Bajirao Mastani (2015). From 2015 to 2018, Chopra starred as Alex Parrish in the ABC thriller series Quantico, becoming the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series. Founding the production company Purple Pebble Pictures in 2015, she produced several films under it, including the Marathi film Ventilator (2016) and the Hindi biopic The Sky Is Pink (2019). Chopra has acted in Hollywood films, such as Baywatch (2017), Isn't It Romantic (2019), The White Tiger (2021), and The Matrix Resurrections (2021). She ventured into music by releasing three singles and into writing with her memoir Unfinished (2021), which reached The New York Times Best Seller list. Her other ventures include tech investments, a haircare brand, a restaurant, and a homeware line. Chopra promotes social causes such as environment and women's rights and is vocal about gender equality, the gender pay gap, and feminism. She has worked with UNICEF since 2006 and was appointed as the national and global UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for child rights in 2010 and 2016, respectively. Her namesake foundation for health and education works towards providing support to underprivileged Indian children. Despite maintaining privacy, Chopra's off-screen life, including her marriage to American singer and actor Nick Jonas, is the subject of substantial media coverage; the couple have one daughter.","[['is', 'Indian'], ['received', 'accolades including two National Film Award'], ['received', 'numerous accolades'], ['received', 'accolades'], ['received', 'numerous accolades including two National Film Award'], ['study', 'aeronautical engineering'], ['study', 'engineering'], ['played lady in', 'box office'], ['had', 'her breakout role'], ['played', 'leading lady'], ['played', 'lady'], ['reprised', 'her role'], ['reprised', 'her role in their sequels'], ['established', 'herself'], ['won National Film Award for', 'Actress'], ['playing', 'troubled model'], ['won', 'National Film Award'], ['playing', 'model'], ['won National Film Award for', 'Best Actress'], ['playing model in', '2008'], ['playing model in', 'drama Fashion'], ['gained', 'further praise'], ['gained', 'praise'], ['starred From', '2015 to 2018'], ['starred as', 'Alex Parrish in ABC thriller series'], ['starred as', 'Alex Parrish'], ['produced films including', 'Marathi film Ventilator'], ['produced', 'films'], ['produced films under', 'it'], ['produced', 'several films'], ['Founding production company in', '2015'], ['Founding', 'production company'], ['ventured into', 'writing'], ['ventured by', 'releasing three singles'], ['ventured into', 'writing with her memoir Unfinished'], ['ventured by', 'three singles'], ['ventured into', 'writing with her memoir'], ['ventured into', 'music'], ['memoir', '2021'], ['promotes', 'causes'], ['promotes', 'social causes'], ['was', 'appointed as national UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for child rights'], ['was appointed respectively as', 'national UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador'], ['was appointed as', 'national UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador'], ['was appointed as', 'UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador'], ['was', 'appointed as UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for child rights respectively'], ['was', 'appointed as national UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for child rights respectively'], ['was appointed for', 'child rights'], ['was', 'appointed'], ['has worked with', 'UNICEF'], ['was appointed respectively for', 'child rights'], ['was', 'appointed respectively'], ['was', 'appointed as UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for child rights'], ['was appointed respectively as', 'UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador'], ['has worked since', '2006'], ['has', 'screen life including marriage to American singer']]","[['receivedIncluding', 'accolades'], ['receivedIncluding', 'two_National_Film_Award'], ['received', 'numerous_accolades'], ['received', 'accolades'], ['receivedIncluding', 'numerous_accolades'], ['studyEngineering', 'aeronautical_engineering'], ['studyEngineering', 'engineering'], ['playedIn', 'box_office'], ['had', 'breakout_role'], ['played', 'leading_lady'], ['played', 'lady'], ['reprised', 'role'], ['reprisedIn', 'role'], ['appearedIn', 'their_sequels'], ['established', 'herself'], ['awardFor', 'Actress'], ['playing', 'troubled_model'], ['won', 'National_Film_Award'], ['playingModel', 'model'], ['wonFor', 'Best_Actress'], ['playingModel', 'drama'], ['gained', 'further_praise'], ['gained', 'praise'], ['starredIn', 'Alex_Parrish'], ['starredIn', 'ABC_thriller_series'], ['starredAs', 'Alex_Parrish'], ['producedIncluding', 'Marathi_film_Ventilator'], ['produced', 'films'], ['produced', 'several_films'], ['foundingCompany', 'production_company'], ['releasing', 'three_singles'], ['venturedWith', 'memoir'], ['venturedBy', 'three_singles'], ['venturedInto', 'music'], ['promotes', 'social_causes'], ['workedFor', 'national_UNICEF_Goodwill_Ambassador'], ['ambassadorFor', 'child_rights'], ['servedAs', 'national_UNICEF_Goodwill_Ambassador'], ['appointedAs', 'UNICEF_Goodwill_Ambassador'], ['workedFor', 'UNICEF_Goodwill_Ambassador'], ['workedWith', 'UNICEF'], ['returnsTo', 'screen_life'], ['marriageTo', 'marriage'], ['marriageTo', 'American_singer']]"
55,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Ernest_Hemingway,Ernest Hemingway,"Ernest Miller Hemingway (July 21, 1899 – July 2, 1961) was an American novelist, short-story writer, and journalist. His economical and understated style—which he termed the iceberg theory—had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his adventurous lifestyle and public image brought him admiration from later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and he was awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize in Literature. He published seven novels, six short-story collections, and two nonfiction works. Three of his novels, four short-story collections, and three nonfiction works were published posthumously. Many of his works are considered classics of American literature. Hemingway was raised in Oak Park, Illinois. After high school, he was a reporter for a few months for The Kansas City Star before leaving for the Italian Front to enlist as an ambulance driver in World War I. In 1918, he was seriously wounded and returned home. His wartime experiences formed the basis for his novel A Farewell to Arms (1929). In 1921, he married Hadley Richardson, the first of four wives. They moved to Paris, where he worked as a foreign correspondent and fell under the influence of the modernist writers and artists of the 1920s' ""Lost Generation"" expatriate community. Hemingway's debut novel The Sun Also Rises was published in 1926. He divorced Richardson in 1927, and married Pauline Pfeiffer. They divorced after he returned from the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), which he covered as a journalist and which was the basis for his novel For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940). Martha Gellhorn became his third wife in 1940. He and Gellhorn separated after he met Mary Welsh in London during World War II. Hemingway was present with Allied troops as a journalist at the Normandy landings and the liberation of Paris. He maintained permanent residences in Key West, Florida (in the 1930s) and in Cuba (in the 1940s and 1950s). He almost died in 1954 after two plane crashes on successive days, with injuries leaving him in pain and ill health for much of the rest of his life. In 1959, he bought a house in Ketchum, Idaho, where, in mid-1961, he died by suicide.","[['was', 'American'], ['termed', 'iceberg theory'], ['was awarded', '1954 Nobel Prize in Literature'],

She is known for her image reinventions and musical versatility. Gaga began performing as a teenager, singing at open mic nights and acting in school plays. She studied at Collaborative Arts Project 21, through the New York University Tisch School of the Arts, before dropping out to pursue a career in music. After Def Jam Recordings canceled her contract, she worked as a songwriter for Sony/ATV Music Publishing, where she signed a joint deal with Interscope Records and KonLive Distribution, in 2007. Gaga had her breakthrough the following year with her debut studio album, The Fame, and its chart-topping singles ""Just Dance"" and ""Poker Face"". The album was later reissued to include the extended play The Fame Monster (2009), which yielded the successful singles ""Bad Romance"", ""Telephone"", and ""Alejandro"". Gaga's five succeeding studio albums all debuted atop the US Billboard 200. Her second full-length album, Born This Way (2011), explored electronic rock and techno-pop and sold more than one million copies in its first week. The title track became the fastest-selling song on the iTunes Store, with over one million downloads in less than a week. Following her EDM-influenced third album, Artpop (2013), and its lead single ""Applause"", Gaga released the jazz album Cheek to Cheek (2014) with Tony Bennett, and the soft rock album Joanne (2016). She ventured into acting, winning awards for her leading roles in the miniseries American Horror Story: Hotel (2015–2016) and the musical film A Star Is Born (2018). Her contributions to the latter's soundtrack, which spawned the chart-topping single ""Shallow"", made her the first woman to win an Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Golden Globe Award, and Grammy Award in one year. Gaga returned to dance-pop with her sixth studio album, Chromatica (2020), which yielded the number-one single ""Rain on Me"". She followed this with her second collaborative album with Bennett, Love for Sale, and a starring role in the biopic House of Gucci, both in 2021. Having sold an estimated 170 million records, Gaga is one of the world's best-selling music artists and the only female artist to achieve four singles that each sold at least 10 million copies globally. Her accolades include 13 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, 18 MTV Video Music Awards, awards from the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Council of Fashion Designers of America, and recognition as Billboard's Artist of the Year (2010) and Woman of the Year (2015).

Time magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2010 and 2019 and placed her on their All-Time 100 Fashion Icons list. Her philanthropy and activism focus on mental health awareness and LGBT rights; she has her own non-profit organization, the Born This Way Foundation, which supports the wellness of young people.

His films are characterized by frequent references to popular culture and film genres, non-linear storylines, dark humor, stylized violence, a counterpoint between extended dialogue and visual storytelling, pervasive use of profanity, cameos and ensemble casts. Other directorial tropes that identify his style include the use of songs from the 1960s and 70s, fictional brand parodies, and imagery of women's bare feet. Tarantino began his career as an independent filmmaker with the release of the crime film Reservoir Dogs in 1992. His second film, Pulp Fiction (1994), a dark comedy crime thriller, was a major success with critics and audiences winning numerous awards, including the Palme d'Or and the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. In 1996, he appeared in From Dusk till Dawn, also writing the screenplay. Tarantino's third film, Jackie Brown (1997), paid homage to blaxploitation films. In 2003, Tarantino directed Kill Bill: Volume 1, inspired by the traditions of martial arts films; it was followed by Volume 2 in 2004. He then made the exploitation slasher Death Proof (2007), part of a double feature with Robert Rodriguez, released under the collective title Grindhouse. His next film Inglourious Basterds (2009) told an alternate history with the war film genre. He followed this with Django Unchained (2012), a slave revenge Spaghetti Western, which won him his second Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Tarantino's eighth film, The Hateful Eight (2015), was a revisionist Western thriller and opened to audiences with a roadshow release. His most recent film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), is a comedy drama set in the late 1960s about the transition of Old Hollywood to New Hollywood. A novelization of the film was also published in 2021, becoming his debut novel. Tarantino's work has been subject to controversy, such as the depictions of violence, frequent inclusion of racial slurs and the alleged negligence of safety in his handling of stunt scenes on Kill Bill: Volume 2. During his career, Tarantino's films have garnered a cult following, as well as critical and commercial success. He has been considered ""the single most influential director of his generation"", and listed as one of the most influential people in the world.

63,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/American_Civil_War,American Civil War,"The American Civil War (April 12, 1861 – May 26, 1865; also known by other names) was a civil war in the United States. It was fought between the Union (""the North"") and the Confederacy (""the South""), the latter formed by states that had seceded. The central cause of the war was the dispute over whether slavery would be permitted to expand into the western territories, leading to more slave states, or be prevented from doing so, which was widely believed would place slavery on a course of ultimate extinction. Decades of political controversy over slavery were brought to a head by the victory in the 1860 U.S. presidential election of Abraham Lincoln, who opposed slavery's expansion into the west. An initial seven southern slave states responded to Lincoln's victory by seceding from the United States and, in 1861, forming the Confederacy. The Confederacy seized U.S. forts and other federal assets within their borders. Led by Confederate President Jefferson Davis, the Confederacy ultimately came to control over half of U.S. territory in eleven of the 34 U.S. states that then existed. Four years of intense combat, mostly in the South, ensued. During 1861–1862 in the war's Western Theater, the Union made significant permanent gains—though in the war's Eastern Theater the conflict was inconclusive. On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, declaring all slaves in states in rebellion to be free, which made ending slavery a war goal. To the west, the Union destroyed the Confederate's river navy by the summer of 1862, then much of its western armies, and seized New Orleans. The successful 1863 Union siege of Vicksburg split the Confederacy in two at the Mississippi River. In 1863, Confederate General Robert E. Lee's incursion north ended at the Battle of Gettysburg. Western successes led to General Ulysses S. Grant's command of all Union armies in 1864. Inflicting an ever-tightening naval blockade of Confederate ports, the Union marshaled resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions. This led to the fall of Atlanta in 1864 to Union General William Tecumseh Sherman, followed by his march to the sea. The last significant battles raged around the ten-month Siege of Petersburg, gateway to the Confederate capital of Richmond. The Confederates abandoned Richmond, and on April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered to Grant following the Battle of Appomattox Court House, setting in motion the end of the war. A wave of Confederate surrenders followed. On April 14, just five days after Lee's surrender, Lincoln was assassinated. As a practical matter, the war ended with the May 26 surrender of the Department of the Trans-Mississippi but the conclusion of the American Civil War lacks a clear and precise historical end date. Confederate ground forces continued surrendering past the May 26 surrender date until June 23. By the end of the war, much of the South's infrastructure was destroyed, especially its railroads. The Confederacy collapsed, slavery was abolished, and four million enslaved black people were freed. The war-torn nation then entered the Reconstruction era in an attempt to rebuild the country, bring the former Confederate states back into the United States, and grant civil rights to freed slaves. The Civil War is one of the most extensively studied and written about episodes in U.S. history. It remains the subject of cultural and historiographical debate. Of particular interest is the persisting myth of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. The American Civil War was among the first wars to utilize industrial warfare. Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, the ironclad warship, and mass-produced weapons were all widely used during the war. In total, the war left between 620,000 and 750,000 soldiers dead, along with an undetermined number of civilian casualties, making the Civil War the deadliest military conflict in American history. The technology and brutality of the Civil War foreshadowed the coming World Wars.","[['was', 'war'], ['was', 'war'], ['was', 'civil war'], ['was civil war in', 'United States'], ['was war in', 'United States'], ['was war in', 'United States'], ['was civil', 'States'], ['was civil war in', 'United States'], ['was', 'civil war'], ['was fought between', 'Union'], ['was', 'fought'], ['is one of', 'most extensively studied'], ['is one', 'extensively studied'], ['is one', 'studied about episodes in U.S. history'], ['is one of', 'extensively studied'], ['is one of', 'studied about episodes'], ['is one', 'most extensively studied about episodes in U.S. history'], ['is one', 'most extensively studied about episodes'], ['is one of', 'extensively studied about episodes'], ['is one', 'extensively studied about episodes in U.S. history'], ['is one', 'extensively studied about episodes'], ['is one of', 'extensively studied about episodes in U.S. history'], ['is one of', 'most extensively studied about episodes'], ['is one of', 'studied'], ['is one', 'studied about episodes'], ['is one', 'most extensively studied'], ['is one of', 'studied about episodes in U.S. history'], ['is one', 'studied'], ['is one of', 'most extensively studied about episodes in U.S. history'], ['remains', 'subject of cultural debate'], ['subject of', 'debate'], ['remains', 'subject'], ['subject of', 'cultural debate'], ['remains', 'subject of debate'], ['military conflict in', 'history'], ['deadliest military conflict in', 'history'], ['conflict in', 'history'], ['deadliest military conflict in', 'American history'], ['deadliest conflict in', 'history'], ['conflict in', 'American history'], ['deadliest conflict in', 'American history'], ['military conflict in', 'American history']]","[['american', 'civil_war'], ['occurredIn', 'United_States'], ['civil', 'States'], ['between', 'Union'], ['in', 'episodes'], ['episodesIn', 'U.S._history'], ['isAbout', 'episodes'], ['regardlessOf', 'subject'], ['subjectOf', 'cultural_debate'], ['subjectOf', 'debate'], ['remains', 'subject'], ['conflictIn', 'history'], ['battlefieldIn', 'American_history']]"
64,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Winston_Churchill,Winston Churchill,"Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill (30 November 1874 – 24 January 1965) was a British statesman, soldier, and writer who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom twice, from 1940 to 1945 during the Second World War, and again from 1951 to 1955. Apart from two years between 1922 and 1924, he was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1900 to 1964 and represented a total of five constituencies. Ideologically an economic liberal and imperialist, he was for most of his career a member of the Conservative Party, which he led from 1940 to 1955. He was a member of the Liberal Party from 1904 to 1924. Of mixed English and American parentage, Churchill was born in Oxfordshire to a wealthy, aristocratic family. He joined the British Army in 1895 and saw action in British India, the Anglo-Sudan War, and the Second Boer War, gaining fame as a war correspondent and writing books about his campaigns. Elected a Conservative MP in 1900, he defected to the Liberals in 1904. In H. H. Asquith's Liberal government, Churchill served as President of the Board of Trade and Home Secretary, championing prison reform and workers' social security. As First Lord of the Admiralty during the First World War, he oversaw the Gallipoli Campaign but, after it proved a disaster, he was demoted to Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He resigned in November 1915 and joined the Royal Scots Fusiliers on the Western Front for six months. In 1917, he returned to government under David Lloyd George and served successively as Minister of Munitions, Secretary of State for War, Secretary of State for Air, and Secretary of State for the Colonies, overseeing the Anglo-Irish Treaty and British foreign policy in the Middle East. After two years out of Parliament, he served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in Stanley Baldwin's Conservative government, returning the pound sterling in 1925 to the gold standard at its pre-war parity, a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure and depressing the UK economy. Out of government during his so-called ""wilderness years"" in the 1930s, Churchill took the lead in calling for British rearmament to counter the growing threat of militarism in Nazi Germany. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was re-appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. In May 1940, he became Prime Minister, succeeding Neville Chamberlain. Churchill formed a national government and oversaw British involvement in the Allied war effort against the Axis powers, resulting in victory in 1945. After the Conservatives' defeat in the 1945 general election, he became Leader of the Opposition. Amid the developing Cold War with the Soviet Union, he publicly warned of an ""iron curtain"" of Soviet influence in Europe and promoted European unity. Between his terms as Prime Minister, he authored several books recounting his experience during the war for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1953. He lost the 1950 election, but was returned to office in 1951. His second term was preoccupied with foreign affairs, especially Anglo-American relations and the preservation of what remained of the British Empire with India now no longer part of it. Domestically, his government emphasised housebuilding and completed the development of a nuclear weapon (begun by his predecessor). In declining health, Churchill resigned as Prime Minister in 1955, although he remained an MP until 1964. Upon his death in 1965, he was given a state funeral. Widely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Churchill remains popular in the Anglosphere, where he is seen as a victorious wartime leader who played an important role in defending Europe's liberal democracy against the spread of fascism. On the other hand, he has been criticised for some wartime events and also for his imperialist views.","[['was', 'British'], ['was Member from', '1900 to 1964'], ['was', 'Member'], ['was', 'Member of Parliament from 1900 to 1964'], ['was Member Apart', 'two years'], ['was Member of', 'Parliament'], ['was for', 'most of his career'], ['led from', '1940 to 1955'], ['was for', 'most'], ['was member of', 'Liberal Party'], ['was', 'member of Liberal Party from 1904 to 1924'], ['was', 'member'], ['was member from', '1904 to 1924'], ['was', 'Of English born to family'], ['was born in', 'Oxfordshire'], ['was', 'Of mixed English born to wealthy aristocratic family'], ['was', 'Of mixed English born to wealthy family'], ['was born to', 'aristocratic family'], ['was born Of', 'English'], ['was', 'born'], ['was born to', 'family'], ['was born to', 'wealthy aristocratic family'], ['was born Of', 'mixed English'], ['was', 'born in Oxfordshire to aristocratic family'], ['was', 'born in Oxfordshire to wealthy family'], ['was', 'Of English born to aristocratic family'], ['was', 'Of English born in Oxfordshire to aristocratic family'], ['was', 'Of mixed English born in Oxfordshire to wealthy aristocratic family'], ['was', 'Of English born in Oxfordshire to wealthy family'], ['was', 'Of mixed English born to family'], ['was born to', 'wealthy family'], ['was', 'Of mixed English born in Oxfordshire to family'], ['was', 'born in Oxfordshire to wealthy aristocratic family'], ['was', 'Of English born in Oxfordshire to wealthy aristocratic family'], ['was', 'Of mixed English born in Oxfordshire'], ['was', 'Of English born in Oxfordshire'], ['was', 'Of mixed English born in Oxfordshire to wealthy family'], ['was', 'Of English born to wealthy family'], ['was', 'Of English born in Oxfordshire to family'], ['was', 'Of mixed English born to aristocratic family'], ['was', 'Of mixed English born in Oxfordshire to aristocratic family'], ['was', 'born in Oxfordshire to family'], ['was', 'Of English born to wealthy aristocratic family'], ['saw', 'action in India'], ['joined Army in', '1895'], ['saw', 'action in British India'], ['joined', 'British Army'], ['joined', 'Army'], ['saw', 'action'], ['defected in', '1904'], ['defected to', 'Liberals'], ['Elected', 'MP'], ['Elected', 'Conservative MP'], ['Elected MP in', '1900'], ['served In', ""H.

It is the largest of four constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The Netherlands consists of twelve provinces; it borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, with a North Sea coastline to the north and west. It shares maritime borders with the United Kingdom, Germany and Belgium in the North Sea. The country's official language is Dutch, with West Frisian as a secondary official language in the province of Friesland. Dutch Low Saxon and Limburgish are recognised regional languages, while Dutch Sign Language, Sinte Romani and Yiddish are recognised non-territorial languages. Dutch, English and Papiamento are official in the Caribbean territories. The four largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's most populous city and the nominal capital. The Hague holds the seat of the States General, Cabinet and Supreme Court. The Port of Rotterdam is the busiest seaport in Europe. Schiphol is the busiest airport in the Netherlands, and the third busiest in Europe. The Netherlands is a founding member of the European Union, Eurozone, G10, NATO, OECD, and WTO, as well as a part of the Schengen Area and the trilateral Benelux Union. It hosts several intergovernmental organisations and international courts, many of which are centred in The Hague. Netherlands literally means ""lower countries"" in reference to its low elevation and flat topography, with only about 50% of its land exceeding 1 m (3.3 ft) above sea level, and nearly 26% falling below sea level. Most of the areas below sea level, known as polders, are the result of land reclamation that began in the 14th century. In the Republican period, which began in 1588, the Netherlands entered a unique era of political, economic, and cultural greatness, ranked among the most powerful and influential in Europe and the world; this period is known as the Dutch Golden Age. During this time, its trading companies, the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company, established colonies and trading posts all over the world. With a population of 17.7 million people, all living within a total area of 41,850 km2 (16,160 sq mi)—of which the land area is 33,500 km2 (12,900 sq mi)—the Netherlands is the 16th most densely populated country in the world and the second-most densely populated country in the European Union, with a density of 529 people per square kilometre (1,370 people/sq mi). Nevertheless, it is the world's second-largest exporter of food and agricultural products by value, owing to its fertile soil, mild climate, intensive agriculture, and inventiveness. The Netherlands has been a parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a unitary structure since 1848. The country has a tradition of pillarisation and a long record of social tolerance, having legalised abortion, prostitution and human euthanasia, along with maintaining a liberal drug policy. The Netherlands abolished the death penalty in Civil Law in 1870, though it was not completely removed until a new constitution was approved in 1983.

66,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Stephen_Hawking,Stephen Hawking,"Stephen William Hawking CH CBE FRS FRSA (8 January 1942 – 14 March 2018) was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author who, at the time of his death, was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge. Between 1979 and 2009, he was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, widely viewed as one of the most prestigious academic posts in the world. Hawking was born in Oxford into a family of physicians. In October 1959, at the age of 17, he began his university education at University College, Oxford, where he received a first-class BA degree in physics. In October 1962, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall at the University of Cambridge where, in March 1966, he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology. In 1963, at age 21, Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease that gradually, over decades, paralysed him. After the loss of his speech, he communicated through a speech-generating device initially through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle. Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a major breakthrough in theoretical physics. Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. Hawking achieved commercial success with several works of popular science in which he discussed his theories and cosmology in general. His book A Brief History of Time appeared on the Sunday Times bestseller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks. Hawking was a Fellow of the Royal Society, a lifetime member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. In 2002, Hawking was ranked number 25 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. He died in 2018 at the age of 76, after living with motor neurone disease for more than 50 years.","[['author', 'at time of his death director of research at Centre for Theoretical Cosmology'],

67,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Arnold_Schwarzenegger,Arnold Schwarzenegger,"Arnold Schwarzenegger (born July 30, 1947) is an Austrian and American actor, film producer, businessman, retired professional bodybuilder and politician who served as the 38th governor of California between 2003 and 2011. Time magazine named Schwarzenegger one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2004 and 2007. Schwarzenegger began lifting weights at the age of 15 and went on to win the Mr. Universe title at age 20 and subsequently won the Mr. Olympia title seven times. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest bodybuilders of all time, and has written many books and articles about bodybuilding. The Arnold Sports Festival, considered the second-most important bodybuilding event after Mr. Olympia, is named after him. He appeared in the bodybuilding documentary Pumping Iron (1977). Schwarzenegger retired from bodybuilding and gained worldwide fame as a Hollywood action star, with his breakthrough in the sword and sorcery epic Conan the Barbarian (1982), a box-office hit with a sequel in 1984. After playing the title character in the science fiction film The Terminator (1984), he starred in the sequels Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003), Terminator Genisys (2015), and Terminator: Dark Fate (2019). His other successful action films included Commando (1985), The Running Man (1987), Predator (1987), Red Heat (1988), Total Recall (1990), and True Lies (1994), in addition to comedy films such as Twins (1988), Kindergarten Cop (1990), Junior (1994), and Jingle All the Way (1996). He is the founder of the film production company Oak Productions. As a Republican candidate, Schwarzenegger was first elected on October 7, 2003, in a special recall election to replace then-Governor Gray Davis. He received 48.6% of the vote, 17 points ahead of Democrat runner-up Cruz Bustamante. He was sworn in on November 17 to serve the remainder of Davis' term, and was re-elected in the 2006 California gubernatorial election with an increased vote share of 55.9% to serve a full term as governor. In 2011, he reached his term limit as governor and returned to acting. Schwarzenegger was nicknamed the ""Austrian Oak"" in his bodybuilding days, ""Arnie"" or ""Schwarzy"" during his acting career, and ""the Governator"" (a portmanteau of ""Governor"" and ""Terminator"") during his political career. He married Maria Shriver, a niece of President John F. Kennedy, in 1986. They separated in 2011 after he admitted to having fathered a child with their housemaid in 1997; their divorce was finalized in 2021.","[['is', 'Austrian'], ['lifting weights at', 'age of 15'], ['lifting weights at', 'age'], ['lifting', 'weights'], ['is', 'regarded'], ['is', 'widely regarded'], ['appeared in', 'bodybuilding documentary'], ['appeared in', 'documentary'], ['gained', 'fame'], ['retired with', 'his breakthrough'], ['gained fame as', 'Hollywood action star'], ['gained worldwide', 'fame'], ['retired with', 'his breakthrough in sword'], ['gained worldwide fame as', 'Hollywood action star'], ['retired from', 'bodybuilding'], ['playing title character in', 'science fiction film'], ['playing', 'title character'], ['starred in', 'sequels'], ['is', 'founder'], ['is founder of', 'film production company'], ['was first elected As', 'candidate'], ['was', 'first elected'], ['was', 'As Republican candidate first elected on October 7 2003'], ['was', 'elected'], ['was first elected As', 'Republican candidate'], ['was elected As', 'Republican candidate'], ['was', 'As Republican candidate elected on October 7 2003'], ['was elected on', 'October 7 2003'], ['was', 'As candidate elected on October 7 2003'], ['was', 'As candidate first elected on October 7 2003'], ['was elected As', 'candidate'], ['was first elected on', 'October 7 2003'], ['received', '48.6 % of vote'], ['received', '48.6 %'], ['received', '48.6 % 17 points ahead'], ['received', '48.6 % 17 points ahead of Democrat runner up Cruz Bustamante'], ['received', '48.6 % of vote 17 points ahead'], ['received', '48.6 % of vote 17 points ahead of Democrat runner up Cruz Bustamante'], ['was re-elected in', '2006 California gubernatorial election'], ['was re-elected with', 'increased vote share'], ['was re-elected with', 'vote share of 55.9 %'], ['was', 're-elected in 2006 California election with vote share of 55.9 %'], ['was', 're-elected in 2006 California gubernatorial election with increased vote share'], ['was', 're-elected in 2006 California election with vote share'], ['was', 're-elected in 2006 California gubernatorial election with vote share'], ['was', 're-elected in 2006 California gubernatorial election with vote share of 55.9 %'], ['was', 're-elected in 2006 California election with increased vote share'], ['was re-elected with', 'vote share'], ['was re-elected in', '2006 California election'], ['was', 're-elected in 2006 California election with increased vote share of 55.9 %'], ['serve', ""remainder of Davis ' term""], ['was', 're-elected in 2006 California gubernatorial election with increased vote share of 55.9 %'], ['was re-elected with', 'increased vote share of 55.9 %'], ['was', 're-elected'], ['serve', 'remainder'], ['was sworn in on', 'November 17'], ['returned to', 'acting'], ['reached', 'his term limit'], ['reached', 'his term limit as governor'], ['was nicknamed Arnie during', 'his acting career'], ['was nicknamed', 'Oak'], ['was nicknamed Arnie in', 'his bodybuilding days'], ['was nicknamed Oak in', 'his bodybuilding days'], ['was nicknamed Oak during', 'his career'], ['was nicknamed', 'Arnie'], ['was nicknamed', 'Austrian Oak'], ['was nicknamed Arnie during', 'his career'], ['was nicknamed Oak during', 'his acting career'], ['married', 'niece'], ['married', 'Maria Shriver'], ['married Maria Shriver in', '1986'], ['married', 'niece of President John F.

After achieving success in the Western TV series Rawhide, he rose to international fame with his role as the ""Man with No Name"" in Sergio Leone's ""Dollars Trilogy"" of Spaghetti Westerns during the mid-1960s and as antihero cop Harry Callahan in the five Dirty Harry films throughout the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, among others, have made Eastwood an enduring cultural icon of masculinity. Elected in 1986, Eastwood served for two years as the mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. An Academy Award nominee for Best Actor, Eastwood won Best Director and Best Picture for his Western film Unforgiven (1992) and his sports drama Million Dollar Baby (2004). His greatest commercial successes are the adventure comedy Every Which Way but Loose (1978) and its action comedy sequel Any Which Way You Can (1980). Other popular Eastwood films include the Westerns Hang 'Em High (1968) and Pale Rider (1985), the action-war film Where Eagles Dare (1968), the prison film Escape from Alcatraz (1979), the war film Heartbreak Ridge (1986), the action film In the Line of Fire (1993), and the romantic drama The Bridges of Madison County (1995). More recent works are Gran Torino (2008), The Mule (2018), and Cry Macho (2021). Since 1967, Eastwood's company Malpaso Productions has produced all but four of his American films. In addition to directing many of his own star vehicles, Eastwood has also directed films in which he did not appear, such as the mystery drama Mystic River (2003) and the war film Letters from Iwo Jima (2006), for which he received Academy Award nominations, the drama Changeling (2008), and the biographical sports drama Invictus (2009). The war drama biopic American Sniper (2014) set box-office records for the largest January release ever and was also the largest opening ever for an Eastwood film. Eastwood's accolades include four Academy Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, three César Awards, and an AFI Life Achievement Award. In 2000, he received the Italian Venice Film Festival's Golden Lion award, honoring his lifetime achievements. Bestowed two of France's highest civilian honors, he received the Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1994, and the Legion of Honour medal in 2007.","[['is', 'American'], ['rose After', 'success in TV series'], ['rose to', 'fame'], ['rose After', 'achieving success'], ['rose After', 'success'], ['rose After', 'achieving success in TV series'], ['rose After', 'success in Western TV series'], ['rose After', 'achieving success in Western TV series'], ['rose to', 'international fame'], ['enduring icon of', 'masculinity'], ['icon of', 'masculinity'], ['enduring cultural icon of', 'masculinity'], ['cultural icon of', 'masculinity'], ['served as', 'mayor'], ['served for', 'two years'], ['served as', 'mayor of'], ['Elected in', '1986'], ['won Director for', 'his Western film Unforgiven 1992'], ['won', 'Best Director'], ['won Director for', 'his film Unforgiven 1992'], ['won', 'Director'], ['has', 'company'], ['has', 'accolades'], ['honoring', 'his lifetime achievements'], ['received', ""Italian Venice Film Festival 's Golden Lion award""], ['received', ""Venice Film Festival 's Golden Lion award""], ['received Commander in', '1994'], ['received', 'Commander et des Lettres'], ['received', 'Commander'], ['received', 'Commander of Ordre des Arts et des Lettres'], ['received', 'Commander of Ordre des Arts']]","[['roseIn', 'success'], ['roseIn', 'TV_series'], ['roseTo', 'fame'], ['afterAchieving', 'success'], ['roseAfter', 'success'], ['roseIn', 'Western_TV_series'], ['roseTo', 'international_fame'], ['iconOf', 'masculinity'], ['servedAs', 'mayor'], ['servedFor', 'two_years'], ['wonFor', 'his_Western_film'], ['wonFor', 'Unforgiven'], ['won', 'Best_Director'], ['awardFor', 'his_film'], ['won', 'Director'], ['has', 'company'], ['has', 'accolades'], ['honoring', 'his_lifetime_achievements'], ['received', ""Italian_Venice_Film_Festival_'s_Golden_Lion_award""], ['received', ""Venice_Film_Festival_'s_Golden_Lion_award""], ['received', 'Commander_et_des_Lettres'], ['received', 'Commander'], ['recipientOf', 'Commander'], ['commanderOf', 'Ordre_des_Arts_et_des_Lettres'], ['commanderOf', 'Ordre_des_Arts']]"

70,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Sylvester_Stallone,Sylvester Stallone,"Sylvester Enzio Stallone (/stəˈloʊn/; born Michael Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone, July 6, 1946) is an American actor and filmmaker. After his beginnings as a struggling actor for a number of years upon arriving to New York City in 1969 and later Hollywood in 1974, he won his first critical acclaim as an actor for his co-starring role as Stanley Rosiello in The Lords of Flatbush. Stallone subsequently found gradual work as an extra or side character in films with a sizable budget until he achieved his greatest critical and commercial success as an actor and screenwriter, starting in 1976 with his role as boxer Rocky Balboa, in the first film of the successful Rocky series (1976–present), for which he also wrote the screenplays. In the films, Rocky is portrayed as an underdog boxer who fights numerous brutal opponents, and wins the world heavyweight championship twice. In 1977, Stallone was the third actor in cinema to be nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor. Stallone's film Rocky was inducted into the National Film Registry, and had its props placed in the Smithsonian Museum. Stallone's use of the front entrance to the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the Rocky series led the area to be nicknamed the Rocky Steps. Philadelphia has a statue of his character Rocky placed permanently near the museum, and he was voted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Up until 1982, Stallone's films were not big box office successes unless they were Rocky sequels, and none received the critical acclaim achieved with the first Rocky. This changed with the successful action film First Blood in which he portrayed the PTSD-plagued soldier John Rambo. Originally an adaptation of the eponymous novel by David Morell, First Blood’s script was significantly altered by Stallone during the film’s production. Stallone would play the role in a total of five Rambo films (1982–2019). From the mid-1980s through to the late 1990s, Stallone would go on to become one of Hollywood's highest-paid actors of that era by appearing in a slew of commercially successful action films which were however generally panned by critics. These include Cobra, Tango and Cash, Cliffhanger, the better received Demolition Man, and The Specialist. Stallone saw a decline in popularity in the early 2000s but rebounded back to prominence in 2006 with a sixth installment in the Rocky series and 2008 with a fourth in the Rambo series. In the 2010s, Stallone launched The Expendables films series (2010–2014), in which he played the lead as the mercenary Barney Ross. In 2013, he starred in the successful Escape Plan, and acted in its sequels. In 2015, Stallone returned to the Rocky series with Creed, that serve as spin-off films focusing on Adonis ""Donnie"" Creed played by Michael B. Jordan, the son of the ill-fated boxer Apollo Creed, to whom the long-retired Rocky is a mentor. Reprising the role brought Stallone praise, and his first Golden Globe award for the first Creed, as well as a third Oscar nomination, having been first nominated for the same role 40 years prior. Stallone is the only actor in the history of American cinema to have starred in a box office number one film across six consecutive decades. He is also one of the most renowned physical culture icons in history.","[['is', 'American'], ['won', 'his acclaim'], ['won', 'his first acclaim'], ['won', 'his critical acclaim'], ['won', 'his first

71,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Grey's_Anatomy,Grey's Anatomy,"Grey's Anatomy is an American medical drama television series that premiered on March 27, 2005, on ABC as a mid-season replacement. The series focuses on the lives of surgical interns, residents, and attendings as they develop into seasoned doctors while balancing personal and professional relationships. The title is an allusion to Gray's Anatomy, a classic human anatomy textbook first published in 1858 in London and written by Henry Gray. Shonda Rhimes developed the pilot and continued to write for the series until 2015. Krista Vernoff, who previously worked with Rhimes, is now the showrunner. Rhimes was also one of the executive producers alongside Betsy Beers, Mark Gordon, Krista Vernoff, Rob Corn, Mark Wilding, Allan Heinberg, and Ellen Pompeo. Although the series is set in Seattle, Washington, it is filmed primarily in Los Angeles, California, and Vancouver, British Columbia. The series revolves around Ellen Pompeo's character, Dr. Meredith Grey, until halfway through its 19th season, after which it shifts to a more ensemble format, with Pompeo only appearing in 8 episodes of season 19. Grey is first featured as an intern and later becomes the chief of general surgery, while showcasing the complications of a surgeon's life. The original cast consisted of nine star-billed actors: Pompeo, Sandra Oh, Katherine Heigl, Justin Chambers, T. R. Knight, Chandra Wilson, James Pickens Jr., Isaiah Washington, and Patrick Dempsey. The cast has undergone major changes throughout the series' run. At the start of the 19th season, the show had a large ensemble of 17 actors—including three from the original cast (Pompeo, Wilson, and Pickens). Grey's Anatomy is the longest-running scripted primetime show currently airing on ABC, and the longest scripted primetime series carried by ABC. Its success catapulted many longtime series regulars including Pompeo, Dempsey, and Oh to worldwide recognition; they were among the top five highest-earning television actors in 2013. While the show's ratings have fallen over the course of its run (it was once among the overall top-ten shows in the United States), it is still one of the highest-rated shows among the 18–49 demographic, and the #3 drama on all of broadcast television in the United States. The series was the highest revenue-earning show on television in terms of advertising in the 2007–08 season; in 2017, it was ranked tenth on the list. In its 15th season, Grey's Anatomy ranked as ABC's highest-rated drama. As of February 28, 2019, it was the longest-running American primetime medical drama series. On May 10, 2019, the series was renewed for a 16th and 17th season. The 16th season premiered on September 26, 2019. The 17th season premiered on November 12, 2020, about two months later than usual, due to production delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. On May 10, 2021, the series was renewed for an 18th season, with Pompeo, Wilson, and Pickens all returning. The 18th season premiered on September 30, 2021. In January 2022, the series was renewed for a 19th season, with Pompeo agreeing to return. The show now has a second spin-off series named Station 19, in addition to Private Practice. After the mid-season finale of the 19th season, Pompeo took to her Instagram to say farewell as she took a step back and exited as a full-time character in the show, but stated she would return after her exit. Grey's Anatomy has been well received by critics throughout much of its run and has been included in various critics' year-end top 10 lists. Since its inception, the show has been described by the media outlets as a television ""phenomenon"" or a ""juggernaut"", owing to its longevity and dominant ratings. It is considered to have had a significant effect on popular culture and has received numerous awards, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama and a total of 38 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including two for Outstanding Drama Series. The cast members have also received accolades for their individual performances.","[['is', 'American medical drama television series'], ['is American', 'premiered'], ['is', 'drama television series'],

72,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Judy_Garland,Judy Garland,"Judy Garland (born Frances Ethel Gumm; June 10, 1922 – June 22, 1969) was an American actress and singer. While critically acclaimed for many different roles throughout her career, she is widely known for playing the part of Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz (1939). She attained international stardom as an actress in both musical and dramatic roles, as a recording artist and on the concert stage. Renowned for her versatility, she received an Academy Juvenile Award, a Golden Globe Award and a Special Tony Award. Garland was the first woman to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, which she won for her 1961 live recording titled Judy at Carnegie Hall. Garland began performing as a child with her two older sisters, in a vaudeville group """" and was later signed to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as a teenager. She appeared in more than two dozen films for MGM. Garland was a frequent on-screen partner of both Mickey Rooney and Gene Kelly and regularly collaborated with director and second husband Vincente Minnelli. Other starring roles during this period included Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), The Harvey Girls (1946), Easter Parade (1948) and Summer Stock (1950). In 1950, after 15 years with MGM, the studio released her amid a series of personal struggles that prevented her from fulfilling the terms of her contract. Although her film career became intermittent thereafter, two of Garland's most critically acclaimed roles came later in her career: she received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in A Star Is Born (1954) and a nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in Judgment at Nuremberg (1961). She also made record-breaking concert appearances, released eight studio albums and hosted her own Emmy-nominated television series, The Judy Garland Show (1963–1964). At age 39, Garland became the youngest and first female recipient of the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement in the film industry. In 1997, Garland was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Several of her recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and in 1999, the American Film Institute ranked her as the eighth-greatest female screen legend of classic Hollywood cinema. Garland struggled in her personal life from an early age. The pressures of early stardom affected her physical and mental health from the time she was a teenager; her self-image was influenced by constant criticism from film executives who believed that she was physically unattractive and who manipulated her onscreen physical appearance. Throughout her adulthood she was plagued by alcohol and substance abuse, as well as financial instability, often owing hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes. Her lifelong substance use disorder ultimately led to her death from an accidental barbiturate overdose in 1969, at age 47.","[['was', 'American'], ['is known', 'While critically acclaimed for many

73,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Canada,Canada,"Canada is a country in North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering over 9.98 million square kilometres (3.85 million square miles), making it the world's second-largest country by total area. Its southern and western border with the United States, stretching 8,891 kilometres (5,525 mi), is the world's longest binational land border. Canada's capital is Ottawa, and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. Indigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years. Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom. This widening autonomy was highlighted by the Statute of Westminster 1931 and culminated in the Canada Act 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Canada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition. The country's head of government is the prime minister, who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons, and is appointed by the governor general, representing the monarch of Canada, the head of state. The country is a Commonwealth realm and is officially bilingual (English and French) at the federal level. It ranks among the highest in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, education, gender equality and environmental sustainability. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture. A highly developed country, Canada has the 24th highest nominal per capita income globally and the sixteenth-highest ranking on the Human Development Index. Its advanced economy is the eighth-largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada is part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United Nations, NATO, the G7, the Group of Ten, the G20, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Commonwealth of Nations, the Arctic Council, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and the Organization of American States.","[['is country in', 'North America'], ['is', 'country'], ['has', 'capital'], ['was', 'with union of three American colonies formed as

77,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Game_of_Thrones,Game of Thrones,"Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss for HBO. It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, a series of fantasy novels by George R. R. Martin, the first of which is A Game of Thrones. The show was shot in the United Kingdom, Canada, Croatia, Iceland, Malta, Morocco, and Spain. It premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and concluded on May 19, 2019, with 73 episodes broadcast over eight seasons. Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has a large ensemble cast and follows several story arcs throughout the course of the show. The first major arc concerns the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros through a web of political conflicts among the noble families either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from whoever sits on it. A second focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been exiled to Essos and is plotting to return and reclaim the throne. The third follows the Night's Watch, a military order defending the realm against threats from beyond Westeros's northern border. Game of Thrones attracted a record viewership on HBO and has a broad, active, and international fan base. Critics have praised the series for its acting, complex characters, story, scope, and production values, although its frequent use of nudity and violence (including sexual violence) has been subject to criticism. The final season received significant critical backlash for its reduced length and creative decisions, with many considering it a disappointing conclusion. The series received 59 Primetime Emmy Awards, the most by a drama series, including Outstanding Drama Series in 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2019. Its other awards and nominations include three Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation, a Peabody Award, and five nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama. A prequel series, House of the Dragon, premiered on HBO in 2022.","[['Game of is', 'fantasy drama television series created'], ['is', 'American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff for HBO'], ['is', 'American fantasy drama television series created for HBO'], ['Game of is', 'American fantasy drama television series'], ['is', 'American fantasy drama television series created'], ['is', 'fantasy drama television series created for HBO'], ['Game of is', 'American fantasy drama television series created for HBO'], ['is', 'fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff for HBO'], ['Game of is', 'American fantasy drama television series created'], ['is', 'fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff'], ['is', 'fantasy drama television series'], ['Game of is', 'fantasy drama television series created for HBO'], ['is', 'American fantasy drama television series'], ['Game of is', 'fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff'], ['is', 'American created'], ['is', 'American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff'], ['is', 'fantasy drama television series created'], ['Game of is', 'American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff for HBO'], ['Game of is', 'fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff for HBO'], ['Game of is', 'American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff'], ['Game of is', 'fantasy drama television series'], ['is', 'adaptation'], ['is adaptation of', 'Song'], ['is adaptation of', 'Song of Ice'], ['concluded on', 'May 19 2019'], ['concluded with', '73 episodes broadcast over eight seasons'], ['premiered in', 'United States'], ['premiered on', 'HBO'], ['concluded with', '73 episodes broadcast'], ['concluded with', '73 episodes'], ['premiered on', 'April 17 2011'], ['attracted', 'record viewership on HBO'], ['attracted', 'record viewership'], ['has', 'a']]","[['type', 'fantasy_drama_television_series'], ['adaptedFor', 'American_fantasy_drama_television_series'], ['writtenFor', 'David_Benioff'], ['2For', 'HBO'], ['type', 'American_fantasy_drama_television_series'], ['adaptedFor', 'fantasy_drama_television_series'], ['inspiredBy', 'fantasy_drama_television_series'], ['createdBy', 'David_Benioff'], ['inspiredBy', 'American_fantasy_drama_television_series'], ['isCreated', 'fantasy_drama_television_series'], ['type', 'adaptation'], ['adaptationOf', 'Song'], ['songOf', 'Ice'], ['concludedOn', 'May'], ['airedOver', '73_episodes'], ['broadcastOver', 'eight_seasons'], ['premieredIn', 'United_States'], ['premieredOn', 'HBO'], ['broadcast', '73_episodes'], ['concludedWith', '73_episodes'], ['premieredOn', 'April'], ['drewOn', 'record_viewership'], ['attracted', 'record_viewership']]"

79,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Scarlett_Johansson,Scarlett Johansson,"Scarlett Ingrid Johansson (/dʒoʊˈhænsən/; born November 22, 1984) is an American actress. The world's highest-paid actress in 2018 and 2019, she has featured multiple times on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list. Time magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2021. Her films have grossed over $14.3 billion worldwide, making Johansson the highest-grossing box office star of all time. She has received various accolades, including a Tony Award and a British Academy Film Award, in addition to nominations for two Academy Awards and five Golden Globe Awards. Born to a Danish father and an American mother, Johansson aspired to be an actress from an early age and first appeared on stage in an off-Broadway play as a child actor. She made her film debut in the fantasy comedy North (1994), and gained early recognition for her roles in Manny & Lo (1996), The Horse Whisperer (1998), and Ghost World (2001). Johansson shifted to adult roles in 2003 with her performances in Lost in Translation, which won her a BAFTA Award for Best Actress, and Girl with a Pearl Earring. She was nominated for Golden Globe Awards for these films, and for playing a troubled teenager in the drama A Love Song for Bobby Long (2004) and a seductress in psychological thriller Match Point (2005). The latter was her first collaboration with Woody Allen, who later directed her in Scoop (2006) and Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008). Johansson's other works of this period include The Prestige (2006) and the albums Anywhere I Lay My Head (2008) and Break Up (2009), both of which charted on the Billboard 200. In 2010, Johansson debuted on Broadway in a revival of A View from the Bridge, which won her a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress, and began portraying Black Widow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Iron Man 2. She reprised the role in eight films, most recently in her solo feature Black Widow (2021), gaining global recognition for her performances. During this period, Johansson starred in the science fiction films Her (2013), Under the Skin (2013) and Lucy (2014). She received two simultaneous Academy Award nominations—Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress—for the respective roles of an actress going through a divorce in the drama Marriage Story (2019) and a single mother in Nazi Germany in the satire Jojo Rabbit (2019), becoming one of the few actors to achieve this feat. Labeled a sex symbol, Johansson has been referred to as one of the world's most attractive women by various media outlets. She is a prominent brand endorser and supports several charitable causes. Divorced from actor Ryan Reynolds and businessman Romain Dauriac, Johansson has been married to comedian Colin Jost since 2020.

80,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/George_Harrison,George Harrison,"George Harrison MBE (25 February 1943 – 29 November 2001) was an English musician and singer-songwriter who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Sometimes called ""the quiet Beatle"", Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of popular music through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and Hindu-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work. Although the majority of the band's songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group include ""Taxman"", ""Within You Without You"", ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"", ""Here Comes the Sun"" and ""Something"". Harrison's earliest musical influences included George Formby and Django Reinhardt; Carl Perkins, Chet Atkins and Chuck Berry were subsequent influences. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through his interest in Bob Dylan and the Byrds, and towards Indian classical music through his use of Indian instruments, such as sitar, which he had become acquainted with on the set of the movie Help! On numerous Beatles songs he would play the sitar, starting with ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"". Having initiated the band's embracing of Transcendental Meditation in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the Hare Krishna movement. After the band's break-up in 1970, Harrison released the triple album All Things Must Pass, a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, ""My Sweet Lord"", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the slide guitar. He also organised the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh with Indian musician Ravi Shankar, a precursor to later benefit concerts such as Live Aid. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles' Apple record label before founding Dark Horse Records in 1974; he co-founded HandMade Films in 1978, initially to produce the Monty Python troupe's comedy film The Life of Brian (1979). Harrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the platinum-selling supergroup the Traveling Wilburys. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by Badfinger, Ronnie Wood and Billy Preston, and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr and Tom Petty, among others. Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"". He is a two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee – as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in 2004. Harrison's first marriage, to model Pattie Boyd in 1966, ended in divorce in 1977. The following year he married Olivia Arias, with whom he had a son, Dhani. Harrison died from lung cancer in 2001 at the age of 58, two years after surviving a knife attack by an intruder at his home, Friar Park. His remains were cremated, and the ashes were scattered according to Hindu tradition in a private ceremony in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India. He left an estate of almost £100 million.","[['embraced', 'culture'], ['called', 'quiet Beatle'], ['Sometimes called', 'quiet Beatle'], ['embraced', 'Indian culture'], ['called', 'Beatle'], ['Sometimes called', 'Beatle'], ['has', 'earliest musical influences'], ['lead Beatles through', 'his interest'], ['lead Beatles into', 'folk rock'], ['lead', 'Beatles'], ['had begun By', '1965'], ['lead Beatles through', 'his interest in Bob Dylan'], ['would play sitar On', 'Beatles songs'], ['would play sitar starting', 'starting Wood'], ['would play', 'sitar'], ['would play sitar On', 'numerous Beatles songs'], ['would play sitar starting', 'starting Norwegian Wood'], ['developed', 'association with Hare Krishna movement'], ['initiated', 'band embracing of Transcendental Meditation in 1967'], ['developed', 'association'], ['initiated', 'band embracing in 1967'], ['initiated', 'band'], ['initiated', 'band embracing'], ['subsequently developed', 'association with Hare Krishna movement'], ['initiated', 'band embracing of Transcendental Meditation'], ['subsequently developed', 'association'], ['released album After', ""band 's break up""], ['released', 'album'], ['released album After', ""band 's break up in 1970""], ['released', 'triple album'], ['organised', '1971 Concert for Bangladesh'], ['also organised', '1971 Concert'], ['also organised', '1971 Concert for Bangladesh'], ['organised', '1971 Concert'], ['released singles as', 'solo performer'], ['released', 'singles'], ['released', 'several selling singles'], ['released', 'best selling singles'], ['released', 'several best selling singles'], ['released', 'several singles'], ['released', 'selling singles'], ['co-founded', 'supergroup'], ['co-founded', 'selling supergroup'], ['co-founded', 'platinum selling supergroup'], ['collaborated with', 'Dylan among others'], ['collaborated on', 'songs'], ['collaborated with', 'Dylan'], ['is', 'two time Rock Hall as member of Beatles'], ['is', 'two time Rock Hall of Fame inductee as member of Beatles in 1988'], ['is', 'two time Rock Hall of Fame inductee'], ['is', 'two time Rock Hall of Fame inductee as member in 1988'], ['is', 'two time Rock Hall as member of Beatles in 1988'], ['is', 'two time Rock Hall of Fame inductee as member of Beatles'], ['is', 'two time Rock Hall as member'], ['is', 'two time Rock Hall as member in 1988'], ['is', 'two time Rock Hall of Fame inductee as member'], ['is', 'two time Rock Hall'], ['has', 'first marriage to model in 1966'], ['married Olivia Arias at_time', 'following year'], ['had', 'Dhani'], ['married Olivia Arias at_time', 'year'], ['had', 'son'], ['died Friar Park from', 'lung cancer'], ['died from', 'lung cancer'], ['died after', 'two years'], ['died Friar Park in', '2001'], ['died Friar Park after', 'two years'], ['died Friar Park at', 'age'], ['died', 'Friar Park'], ['died at', 'age'], ['died at', 'age of 58'], ['died in', '2001'], ['died Friar Park at', 'age of 58'], ['left', 'estate of'], ['left', 'estate']]","[['embraced', 'culture'], ['called', 'quiet_Beatle'], ['embraced', 'Indian_culture'], ['called', 'Beatle'], ['earliest', 'earliest_musical_influences'], ['beatlesThrough', 'his_interest'], ['beatlesInto', 'folk_rock'], ['lead', 'Beatles'], ['in', 'his_interest'], ['interestIn', 'Bob_Dylan'], ['sangOn', 'songs'], ['starting', 'Wood'], ['wouldPlay', 'sitar'], ['sangOn', 'numerous_Beatles_songs'], ['startedStarting', 'Norwegian_Wood'], ['developedWith', 'association'], ['associatedWith', 'Hare_Krishna_movement'], ['embracingOf', 'Transcendental_Meditation'], ['developed', 'association'], ['initiated', 'band'], ['break', 'band'], ['released', 'album'], ['albumAfter', ""band_'s_break""], ['released', 'triple_album'], ['arrangedFor', '1971_Concert'], ['concertFor', 'Bangladesh'], ['organised', '1971_Concert'], ['releasedAs', 'solo_performer'], ['released', 'several_selling_singles'], ['released', 'singles'], ['released', 'several_best_selling_singles'], ['released', 'several_singles'], ['georgeHarrison', 'supergroup'], ['co', 'supergroup'], ['isCo', 'platinum_selling_supergroup'], ['collaboratedAmong', 'Dylan'], ['among', 'others'], ['collaboratedOn', 'songs'], ['collaboratedWith', 'Dylan'], ['oneOf', 'two_time'], ['memberOf', 'Rock_Hall'], ['sonOf', 'member'], ['memberOf', 'Beatles'], ['hallOf', 'Fame_inductee'], ['inductedAs', 'two_time'], ['inductedAs', 'Rock_Hall'], ['inductedAs', 'Fame_inductee'], ['type', 'member'], ['type', 'two_time'], ['type', 'Rock_Hall'], ['accordingTo', 'first_marriage'], ['marriedTo', 'model'], ['had', 'Dhani'], ['married', 'year'], ['had', 'son'], ['diedFrom', 'lung_cancer'], ['diedAfter', 'two_years'], ['diedAt', 'age'], ['died', 'Friar_Park'], ['leftLeft', 'estate']]"

83,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Elvis_Presley,Elvis Presley,"Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977), or simply Elvis, was an American singer and actor. Dubbed the ""King of Rock and Roll"", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, led him to both great success and initial controversy. Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA Victor single, ""Heartbreak Hotel"", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. Within a year, RCA would sell ten million Presley singles. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, Presley became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll, though his performative style and promotion of the then-marginalized sound of African-Americans led to him being widely considered a threat to the moral well-being of the White American youth. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts, however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. Some of his most famous films included Jailhouse Rock (1957), Blue Hawaii (1961), and Viva Las Vegas (1964). In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, Aloha from Hawaii. Years of prescription drug abuse and unhealthy eating habits severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42. Having sold over 500 million records worldwide, Presley is recognized as the best-selling solo music artist of all time by Guinness World Records. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, rhythm & blues, adult contemporary, and gospel. Presley won three Grammy Awards, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame. He holds several records, including the most RIAA certified gold and platinum albums, the most albums charted on the Billboard 200, the most number-one albums by a solo artist on the UK Albums Chart, and the most number-one singles by any act on the UK Singles Chart. In 2018, Presley was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.","[['Dubbed', 'King of Rock'], ['Dubbed', 'King'], ['is', 'regarded'], ['was', 'born'], ['was born in', 'Tupelo with his

84,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/William_Shakespeare,William Shakespeare,"William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616) was an English playwright, poet and actor. He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the ""Bard of Avon"" (or simply ""the Bard""). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. He remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted. Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs and whether the works attributed to him were written by others. Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best works produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until 1608, among them Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in the English language. In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) and collaborated with other playwrights. Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy in his lifetime. However, in 1623, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, John Heminges and Henry Condell, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that included all but two of his plays. Its Preface was a prescient poem by Ben Jonson that hailed Shakespeare with the now famous epithet: ""not of an age, but for all time"".","[['is regarded as', 'writer'], ['is widely regarded as', 'writer'], ['is regarded as', 'greatest writer in English language'], ['is widely regarded as', 'greatest writer in English language'], ['is widely regarded as', 'greatest writer'], ['is', 'regarded'], ['is regarded as', 'writer in English language'], ['is', 'widely regarded'], ['is widely regarded as', 'writer in English language'], ['is regarded as', 'greatest writer'], ['is', 'often called'], ['is often called', ""England 's national poet""], ['is called', ""England 's national poet""], ['is called', ""England 's poet""], ['is often called', ""England 's poet""], ['is', 'called'], ['remains', 'arguably most influential writer'], ['arguably writer in', 'English language'], ['remains', 'arguably writer'], ['most influential writer in', 'English language'], ['continue', 'studied'], ['continue', 'to studied'], ['remains', 'writer'], ['remains', 'writer in English language'], ['influential writer in', 'English language'], ['remains', 'arguably writer in English language'], ['remains', 'most influential writer'], ['arguably influential writer in', 'English language'], ['remains', 'influential writer'], ['remains', 'most influential writer in English language'], ['remains', 'arguably most influential writer in English language'], ['remains', 'influential writer in English language'], ['writer in', 'English language'], ['remains', 'arguably influential writer in English language'], ['arguably most influential writer in', 'English language'], ['remains', 'arguably influential writer'], ['was', 'born'], ['was', 'born in'], ['had', 'three children'], ['married Anne Hathaway At', 'age'], ['married Anne Hathaway At', 'age of 18'], ['married', 'Anne Hathaway'], ['appears', 'to have retired'], ['appears', 'have retired to Stratford'], ['appears', 'have retired'], ['retired to', 'Stratford'], ['appears', 'to have retired to Stratford'], ['appears At', 'age 49 around 1613'], ['appears At', 'age 49'], ['produced', 'most of his works'], ['produced', 'most'], ['produced', 'most of his known works'], ['wrote', 'tragedies'], ['wrote', 'mainly tragedies'], ['wrote tragedies until', '1608 among them'], ['wrote tragicomedies In', 'phase'], ['wrote', 'tragicomedies also known'], ['wrote tragicomedies In', 'phase of his life'], ['wrote', 'tragicomedies known'], ['wrote tragicomedies In', 'last phase of his life'], ['collaborated with', 'other playwrights'], ['wrote', 'tragicomedies'], ['wrote tragicomedies In', 'last phase'], ['collaborated with', 'playwrights'], ['wrote', 'tragicomedies known as romances'], ['wrote', 'tragicomedies also known as romances'], ['has', 'plays'], ['of', 'dramatic works']]","[['regardedAs', 'writer'], ['isIn', 'greatest_writer'], ['worksIn', 'English_language'], ['isAs', 'greatest_writer'], ['isIn', 'writer'], ['isCalled', ""England_'s_national_poet""], ['isCalled', ""England_'s_poet""], ['remains', 'arguably_most_influential_writer'], ['remains', 'arguably_writer'], ['remains', 'writer'], ['remainsIn', 'arguably_writer'], ['remains', 'most_influential_writer'], ['remains', 'influential_writer'], ['remainsIn', 'most_influential_writer'], ['remainsIn', 'arguably_most_influential_writer'], ['remainsIn', 'influential_writer'], ['remainsIn', 'arguably_influential_writer'], ['remains', 'arguably_influential_writer'], ['had', 'three_children'], ['diedAt', 'age'], ['shakespeareMarried', 'Anne_Hathaway'], ['retiredTo', 'Stratford'], ['someOf', 'his_works'], ['mostOf', 'his_known_works'], ['wrote', 'tragedies'], ['wrote', 'mainly_tragedies'], ['among', 'them'], ['wroteIn', 'phase'], ['wrote', 'tragicomedies'], ['outOf', 'phase'], ['storyOf', 'his_life'], ['playsOf', 'last_phase'], ['collaboratedWith', 'other_playwrights'], ['wroteIn', 'last_phase'], ['collaboratedWith', 'playwrights'], ['wroteAs', 'tragicomedies'], ['knownAs', 'romances'], ['libraryOf', 'dramatic_works']]"

87,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Britney_Spears,Britney Spears,"Britney Jean Spears (born December 2, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, and dancer. Often referred to as the ""Princess of Pop"", she is credited with influencing the revival of teen pop during the late 1990s and early 2000s. After appearing in stage productions and television series, Spears signed with Jive Records in 1997 at age fifteen. Her first two studio albums, ...Baby One More Time (1999) and Oops!... I Did It Again (2000), are among the best-selling albums of all time and made Spears the best-selling teenage artist of all time. With first-week sales of over 1.3 million copies, Oops!... I Did It Again held the record for the fastest-selling album by a female artist in the United States for fifteen years. Spears adopted a more mature and provocative style for her albums Britney (2001) and In the Zone (2003), and starred in the 2002 film Crossroads. Spears was executive producer of her fifth studio album Blackout (2007), often referred to as her best work. Following a series of highly publicized personal problems, promotion for the album was limited, and Spears was involuntarily placed in a conservatorship. Since then, she released the chart-topping albums, Circus (2008) and Femme Fatale (2011), the latter of which became her most successful era of singles in the US charts. She embarked on a four-year concert residency, Britney: Piece of Me, at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in Las Vegas to promote her next two albums Britney Jean (2013) and Glory (2016). In 2019, Spears's legal battle over her conservatorship became more publicized and led to the establishment of the #FreeBritney movement. In 2021, the conservatorship was terminated following her public testimony in which she accused her management team and family of abuse. Regarded as a pop icon, Spears has sold over 100 million records worldwide, including over 70 million in the United States, making her one of the world's best-selling music artists. She has achieved six number-one albums on the Billboard 200 and four number-one singles on the US Billboard Hot 100: ""...Baby One More Time"", ""Womanizer"", ""3"", and ""Hold It Against Me"". The ""S&M"" remix also topped the Billboard chart. Her singles ""Oops!... I Did It Again"", ""Toxic"", and ""Scream & Shout"" topped the charts in most countries. With ""3"" in 2009 and ""Hold It Against Me"" in 2011, Spears became the second artist after Mariah Carey in the Hot 100's history to debut at number one with two or more songs. Her heavily choreographed videos earned her the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. She has earned numerous other awards and accolades, including a Grammy Award, 15 Guinness World Records, six MTV Video Music Awards, seven Billboard Music Awards (including the Millennium Award), the inaugural Radio Disney Icon Award, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Spears was ranked by Billboard as the eighth-biggest artist of the 2000s. In the United States, she is the fourth best-selling female album artist of the Nielsen SoundScan era as well as the best-selling female album artist of the 2000s. ""...Baby One More Time"" was named the greatest debut single of all time by Rolling Stone in 2020. In 2004, Spears launched a perfume brand with Elizabeth Arden, Inc.; sales exceeded $1.5 billion as of 2012. Forbes has reported Spears as the highest-earning female musician of 2001 and 2012. By 2012, she had topped Yahoo!'s list of most searched celebrities seven times in twelve years. Time named Spears one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2021, while also winning the reader poll by receiving the highest number of votes.","[['is', 'American'], ['Often referred to',

91,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Marilyn_Monroe,Marilyn Monroe,"Marilyn Monroe (/ˈmærəlɪn mənˈroʊ/; born Norma Jeane Mortenson; June 1, 1926 – August 4, 1962) was an American actress. Famous for playing comedic ""blonde bombshell"" characters, she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s and early 1960s, as well as an emblem of the era's sexual revolution. She was a top-billed actress for a decade, and her films grossed $200 million (equivalent to $2 billion in 2021) by the time of her death in 1962. Long after her death, Monroe remains a major icon of pop culture. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked her sixth on their list of the greatest female screen legends from the Golden Age of Hollywood. Multiple film critics and media outlets have cited Monroe as one of the best actors never to have received an Academy Award nomination. Born and raised in Los Angeles, Monroe spent most of her childhood in a total of 12 foster homes and an orphanage; she married at age sixteen. She was working in a factory during World War II when she met a photographer from the First Motion Picture Unit and began a successful pin-up modeling career, which led to short-lived film contracts with 20th Century Fox and Columbia Pictures. After a series of minor film roles, she signed a new contract with Fox in late 1950. Over the next two years, she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies, including As Young as You Feel and Monkey Business, and in the dramas Clash by Night and Don't Bother to Knock. She faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photographs prior to becoming a star, but the story did not damage her career and instead resulted in increased interest in her films. By 1953, Monroe was one of the most marketable Hollywood stars; she had leading roles in the film noir Niagara, which overtly relied on her sex appeal, and the comedies Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How to Marry a Millionaire, which established her star image as a ""dumb blonde"". The same year, her nude images were used as the centerfold and on the cover of the first issue of Playboy. She played a significant role in the creation and management of her public image throughout her career, but she was disappointed when she was typecast and underpaid by the studio. She was briefly suspended in early 1954 for refusing a film project but returned to star in The Seven Year Itch (1955), one of the biggest box office successes of her career. When the studio was still reluctant to change Monroe's contract, she founded her own film production company in 1954. She dedicated 1955 to building the company and began studying method acting under Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio. Later that year, Fox awarded her a new contract, which gave her more control and a larger salary. Her subsequent roles included a critically acclaimed performance in Bus Stop (1956) and her first independent production in The Prince and the Showgirl (1957). She won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for her role in Some Like It Hot (1959), a critical and commercial success. Her last completed film was the drama The Misfits (1961). Monroe's troubled private life received much attention. She struggled with addiction and mood disorders. Her marriages to retired baseball star Joe DiMaggio and to playwright Arthur Miller were highly publicized, but ended in divorce. On August 4, 1962, she died at age 36 from an overdose of barbiturates at her Los Angeles home. Her death was ruled a probable suicide.","[['was', 'American'], ['emblem of', ""era 's revolution""], ['emblem of', ""era 's sexual revolution""], ['was', 'top billed actress'], ['was billed',

92,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Matthew_McConaughey,Matthew McConaughey,"Matthew David McConaughey (/məˈkɒnəheɪ/ mə-KON-ə-hay; born November 4, 1969) is an American actor. He had his breakout role with a supporting performance in the coming-of-age comedy Dazed and Confused (1993). After a number of supporting roles, his first success as a leading man came in the legal drama A Time to Kill (1996). His career progressed with lead roles in the science fiction film Contact (1997), the historical drama Amistad (1997), and the war film U-571 (2000). In the 2000s, McConaughey became known for starring in romantic comedies, including The Wedding Planner (2001), How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003), Failure to Launch (2006), Fool's Gold (2008), and Ghosts of Girlfriends Past (2009), establishing him as a sex symbol. In 2011, after a two-year hiatus from film acting, McConaughey began to appear in more dramatic roles, beginning with the legal drama The Lincoln Lawyer. In 2012, he gained wider praise for his roles as a stripper in Magic Mike and a fugitive in Mud. McConaughey's portrayal of Ron Woodroof, a cowboy diagnosed with AIDS, in the biopic Dallas Buyers Club (2013) earned him widespread praise and numerous accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Actor. He followed it with a supporting role in The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), and a starring role as Rust Cohle in the first season of HBO's crime anthology series True Detective (2014), for which he was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. His subsequent film roles were not as well-received, with his most notable releases being Interstellar (2014) and The Gentlemen (2019), as well as voice work in Kubo and the Two Strings (2016), Sing (2016) and its sequel Sing 2 (2021).","[['is', 'American'], ['had', 'his breakout role with performance in coming comedy'], ['had', 'his breakout role with supporting performance'], ['had', 'his breakout role'], ['had', 'his breakout role with performance in coming of age comedy'], ['had', 'his breakout role with performance'], ['had', 'his breakout role with supporting performance in coming of age comedy'], ['had', 'his breakout role with supporting performance in comedy'], ['had', 'his breakout role with supporting performance in coming comedy'], ['had', 'his breakout role with performance in comedy'], ['known for', 'starring'], ['became', 'known for starring'], ['became', 'known'], ['became In', '2000s'], ['began', 'appear in dramatic roles'], ['began', 'appear'], ['began In', '2011'], ['began', 'appear in more dramatic roles'], ['appear in', 'roles'], ['appear in', 'more dramatic roles'], ['appear in', 'dramatic roles'], ['began after', 'two year hiatus'], ['began', 'to appear in roles'], ['began', 'to appear'], ['appear beginning', 'beginning legal drama'], ['began', 'to appear in dramatic roles'], ['appear beginning', 'beginning drama'], ['began', 'to appear in more dramatic roles'], ['began', 'appear in roles'], ['began after', 'two year hiatus from film acting'], ['gained praise In', '2012'], ['gained praise for', 'his roles as stripper in Magic Mike'], ['gained', 'wider praise'], ['gained praise for', 'his roles as stripper'], ['gained', 'praise'], ['gained praise for', 'his roles'], ['has', 'portrayal of Ron Woodroof in biopic Dallas Buyers Club 2013'], ['was', 'nominated'], ['was', 'nominated for Primetime Emmy Award for Lead Actor in Drama Series'], ['was', 'nominated for Lead Actor in Drama Series'], ['was', 'nominated for Primetime Emmy Award in Drama Series'], ['was nominated for', 'Lead Actor'], ['followed', 'it'], ['was', 'nominated for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor'], ['was nominated for', 'Primetime Emmy Award'], ['was', 'nominated for Primetime Emmy Award for Lead Actor'], ['was nominated for', 'Outstanding Lead Actor'], ['was', 'nominated for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in Drama Series'], ['was', 'nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor in Drama Series'], ['was nominated in', 'Drama Series']]","[['in', 'breakout_role'], ['continuedIn', 'performance'], ['appearedIn', 'coming_comedy'], ['continuedWith', 'his_breakout_role'], ['continuedWith', 'performance'], ['had', 'breakout_role'], ['spokeOf', 'his_breakout_role'], ['listOf', 'performance'], ['comingOf', 'age_comedy'], ['starredIn', 'comedy'], ['appearedIn', 'dramatic_roles'], ['appearedIn', 'more_dramatic_roles'], ['appearIn', 'roles'], ['beganAfter', 'two_year_hiatus'], ['appearBeginning', 'legal_drama'], ['beginning', 'drama'], ['beganFrom', 'two_year_hiatus'], ['retiredFrom', 'film'], ['excelledIn', 'his_roles'], ['starredIn', 'stripper'], ['starredIn', 'Magic_Mike'], ['gained', 'wider_praise'], ['playedAs', 'his_roles'], ['starredAs', 'stripper'], ['gained', 'praise'], ['wonFor', 'his_roles'], ['appearsIn', 'portrayal'], ['appearsIn', 'Ron_Woodroof'], ['appearsIn', 'biopic'], ['wonIn', 'Primetime_Emmy_Award'], ['asIn', 'Lead_Actor'], ['wonIn', 'Drama'], ['nominatedFor', 'Lead_Actor'], ['nominatedFor', 'Primetime_Emmy_Award'], ['wonFor', 'Outstanding_Lead_Actor'], ['wonIn', 'Outstanding_Lead_Actor'], ['wonIn', 'Drama_Series']]"
93,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Dwayne_Johnson,Dwayne Johnson,"Dwayne Douglas Johnson (born May 2, 1972), also known by his ring name The Rock, is an American actor and former professional wrestler. Widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time, he was integral to the development and success of the WWE during the Attitude Era, an industry boom period in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Johnson wrestled for WWF/E for eight years prior to pursuing an acting career. His films have grossed over $3.5 billion in North America and over $10.5 billion worldwide, making him one of the world's highest-grossing and highest-paid actors. Prior to his emergence as a top-grossing actor beginning in the 2010s, Johnson was an athlete. At Freedom High School in Bethlehem Township, Pennsylvania in the Lehigh Valley, he ultimately emerged as a standout on the school's football and wrestling teams, which competed in the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference, a conference known for producing top professional and Olympic athletes. He credits his high school football coach with helping inspire transformational changes in his life, which before entering sports in 11th grade had been characterized by fights and petty crimes as a high-school teenager. His football capabilities at Freedom High School led him to be ranked as one of the top ten defensive tackle high-school prospects in the nation, drawing the attention of several NCAA Division I college football programs. Johnson accepted an athletic scholarship to play at the University of Miami, one of the country's top college football programs. As a college freshman, he was a member of the University of Miami's 1991 national championship team but largely spent his four college football years at the University of Miami in backup roles behind elite players, including future NFL star and Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Warren Sapp. Johnson aspired to play professional football but went undrafted in the 1995 NFL Draft. Following his graduation from the University of Miami that year, he signed with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League but was cut from the team in his first season. In 1996, Johnson's father Rocky, a longtime professional wrestler, assisted in helping him secure a contract with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). Johnson quickly rose to global prominence, aided by a gimmick he employed as a charismatic trash-talker. The role ushered in the Attitude Era in professional wrestling, which contributed to the industry's boom period in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Johnson left WWE in 2004 and returned in 2011 as a part-time performer until 2013, making sporadic appearances until retiring in 2019. A 10-time world champion, including the promotion's first of African-American descent, he is also a two-time Intercontinental Champion, a five-time Tag Team Champion, the 2000 Royal Rumble winner, and WWE's sixth Triple Crown champion. Johnson headlined the most-bought professional wrestling pay-per-view (WrestleMania XXVIII) and was featured among the most watched episodes of WWE's flagship television series (Raw and SmackDown). Johnson's first film appearance was in The Mummy Returns (2001). The following year he played his first leading role as the titular character in the sword and sorcery film The Scorpion King (2002). He has since starred in family films The Game Plan (2007), Race to Witch Mountain (2009), Tooth Fairy (2010), and Jungle Cruise (2021), as well as the action adventure films Journey 2: The Mysterious Island (2012), G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013), Hercules (2014), Skyscraper (2018), San Andreas (2015) and Rampage (2018). He also starred in the action comedy films Get Smart (2008), Central Intelligence (2016), Baywatch (2017), and Red Notice (2021). In 2016 he voiced Maui in the Disney animated film Moana (2016). His role as Luke Hobbs in the Fast & Furious films, beginning with Fast Five (2011), helped the franchise become one of the highest-grossing in film. He subsequently starred in the spin-off Hobbs & Shaw (2019). Johnson also stars in the Jumanji films, appearing in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017) and Jumanji: The Next Level (2019), and voices Bark Kent / Krypto / Superdog, Anubis, and Teth-Adam / Black Adam in the animated film DC League of Super-Pets (2022), before starring as the latter in the live-action superhero film Black Adam (2022). Johnson produced and starred in the HBO comedy-drama series Ballers (2015–2019) and stars and produces the autobiographical sitcom Young Rock (2021). In 2000, Johnson released his autobiography The Rock Says, which was a New York Times bestseller. In 2012, he co-founded the entertainment production company Seven Bucks Productions and is co-owner of the XFL, a professional American football league. In 2016 and 2019, Johnson was named by Time one of the world's most influential people.","[['was', 'integral to development of WWE during Attitude Era'], ['was integral during', 'Attitude Era'],

94,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Freddie_Mercury,Freddie Mercury,"Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara; 5 September 1946 – 24 November 1991) was a British singer and songwriter, who achieved worldwide fame as the lead vocalist of the rock band Queen. Regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of rock music, he was known for his flamboyant stage persona and four-octave vocal range. Mercury defied the conventions of a rock frontman with his theatrical style, influencing the artistic direction of Queen. Born in 1946 in Zanzibar to Parsi-Indian parents, Mercury attended English-style boarding schools in India from the age of eight and returned to Zanzibar after secondary school. In 1964, his family fled the Zanzibar Revolution, moving to Middlesex, England. Having studied and written music for years, he formed Queen in 1970 with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor. Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including ""Killer Queen"", ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", ""Somebody to Love"", ""We Are the Champions"", ""Don't Stop Me Now"" and ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love"". His charismatic stage performances often saw him interact with the audience, as displayed at the 1985 Live Aid concert. He also led a solo career and was a producer and guest musician for other artists. Mercury was diagnosed with AIDS in 1987. He continued to record with Queen, and posthumously featured on their final album, Made in Heaven (1995). He announced his diagnosis the day before his death, from complications from the disease, in 1991 at the age of 45. In 1992, a concert in tribute to him was held at Wembley Stadium, in benefit of AIDS awareness. His career with Queen was dramatised in the 2018 biopic Bohemian Rhapsody. As a member of Queen, Mercury was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. In 1990, he and the other Queen members were awarded the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music, and one year after his death, Mercury was awarded it individually. In 2005, Queen were awarded an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Song Collection from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors. In 2002, Mercury was voted number 58 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.","[['was', 'British'], ['was known for', 'his flamboyant stage persona'], ['was known for', 'his stage persona'], ['was', 'known'], ['defied', 'conventions'], ['defied', 'conventions of rock frontman'], ['defied', 'conventions of rock frontman with his theatrical style'], ['defied', 'conventions of rock frontman with his style'], ['attended', 'English style boarding schools in India'], ['attended English style boarding schools from', 'age'], ['attended English style boarding schools from', 'age of eight'], ['returned after', 'school'], ['returned to', 'Zanzibar'], ['returned after', 'secondary school'], ['attended', 'English style boarding schools'], ['formed Queen in', '1970'], ['formed Queen with', 'guitarist Brian May'], ['formed', 'Queen'], ['wrote', 'numerous hits'], ['wrote hits including', 'Bohemian Rhapsody'], ['wrote hits including', 'Bohemian Rhapsody'], ['wrote hits including', 'Killer Queen'], ['wrote', 'hits'], ['wrote hits including', 'Rhapsody'], ['wrote hits including', 'Rhapsody'], ['wrote hits for', 'Queen'], ['also led', 'solo career'], ['led', 'solo career'], ['was', 'producer'], ['was', 'diagnosed with AIDS in 1987'], ['was', 'diagnosed'], ['was diagnosed in', '1987'], ['was diagnosed with', 'AIDS'], ['featured on', 'their final album'], ['continued', 'to record'], ['posthumously featured on', 'their final album'], ['continued', 'to record with Queen'], ['continued', 'record'], ['featured on', 'their album'], ['continued', 'record with Queen'], ['posthumously featured on', 'their album'], ['record with', 'Queen'], ['was inducted', 'Songwriters Hall of Fame'], ['was inducted Songwriters Hall into', 'Rock Hall'], ['was posthumously inducted Songwriters Hall into', 'Rock Hall of Fame'], ['was posthumously inducted Songwriters Hall in', '2001'], ['was inducted Songwriters Hall As', 'member of Queen'], ['was posthumously inducted', 'Songwriters Hall'], ['was posthumously inducted Songwriters Hall into', 'Rock Hall'], ['was posthumously inducted', 'Songwriters Hall of Fame'], ['was posthumously inducted Songwriters Hall As', 'member'], ['was inducted', 'Songwriters Hall in 2003'], ['was inducted Songwriters Hall As', 'member'], ['was inducted Songwriters Hall into', 'Rock Hall of Fame'], ['was posthumously inducted', 'Songwriters Hall in 2003'], ['was inducted', 'Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003'], ['was posthumously inducted', 'Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003'], ['was inducted', 'Songwriters Hall'], ['was inducted Songwriters Hall in', '2001'], ['was posthumously inducted Songwriters Hall As', 'member of Queen'], ['was awarded individually', 'it'], ['was awarded', 'it'], ['was', 'voted'], ['was voted', ""number 58 in BBC 's poll of 100 Greatest Britons""], ['was voted', ""number 58 in BBC 's poll""], ['was voted', 'number 58'], ['was voted In', '2002']]","[['knownFor', 'his_flamboyant_stage_persona'], ['knownFor', 'his_stage_persona'], ['attendedConventions', 'conventions'], ['outsideOf', 'conventions'], ['sonOf', 'rock_frontman'], ['brokeWith', 'conventions'], ['workedWith', 'rock_frontman'], ['with', 'his_theatrical_style'], ['with', 'his_style'], ['studiedIn', 'English_style_boarding_schools'], ['livesIn', 'India'], ['diedFrom', 'age'], ['returnedAfter', 'school'], ['returnedTo', 'Zanzibar'], ['returnedAfter', 'secondary_school'], ['attended', 'English_style_boarding_schools'], ['with', 'guitarist_Brian_May'], ['formed', 'Queen'], ['wrote', 'numerous_hits'], ['songsIncluding', 'Bohemian_Rhapsody'], ['songsIncluding', 'Killer_Queen'], ['hitsIncluding', 'Rhapsody'], ['wroteFor', 'Queen'], ['led', 'solo_career'], ['executive', 'producer'], ['diedWith', 'AIDS'], ['featuredOn', 'their_final_album'], ['recordedWith', 'Queen'], ['continuedRecord', 'record'], ['featuredOn', 'their_album'], ['continuedWith', 'record'], ['hallOf', 'Songwriters_Hall'], ['hallOf', 'Fame'], ['inductedInto', 'Rock_Hall'], ['hallOf', 'Rock_Hall'], ['listOf', 'member'], ['memberOf', 'Queen'], ['inducted', 'Songwriters_Hall'], ['As', 'member'], ['outOf', 'number'], ['winnerOf', ""BBC_'s_poll""], ['pollOf', '100_Greatest_Britons'], ['in', 'number'], ['wonIn', ""BBC_'s_poll""], ['voted', 'number']]"

96,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Dilip_Kumar,Dilip Kumar,"Mohammed Yusuf Khan (Urdu pronunciation: [moɦəmːəd̪ juːsʊf xɑːn]; 11 December 1922 – 7 July 2021), better known by his stage name Dilip Kumar, was an Indian actor who worked in Hindi cinema. Credited with pioneering method acting in cinema, he dominated the Indian movie scene from late 1940s throughout 1960s, being referred to as ""Abhinay Samrat"" (Hindi for ""Emperor of Acting"") by the audience. Kumar holds the record for most wins for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor (eight, which was later equalled by Shah Rukh Khan) and was also the inaugural recipient of the award. He holds the best box-office record for a star (male or female) in Hindi cinema with over eighty-percent box-office successes. In a career spanning over five decades, Kumar worked in around 60 films in a variety of roles. He debuted as an actor in the film Jwar Bhata (1944), produced by Bombay Talkies. Following a series of unsuccessful ventures, he had his first box office hit in Jugnu (1947). Kumar found further success with the romantic Andaz (1949), the swashbuckling Aan (1952), the social drama Daag (1952), the dramatic Devdas (1955), the comical Azaad (1955), the romantic social Naya Daur (1957), the noir mystery Madhumati (1958), the comedy-drama Paigham (1959) the epic historical Mughal-E-Azam (1960), the social dacoit crime drama Gunga Jumna (1961), and the comedy drama Ram Aur Shyam (1967). All three Andaz, Aan and Naya Daur briefly became the highest-grossing Indian film up to that point, a feat later achieved by Mughal-e-Azam, which sustained the record for 15 years. As of 2021, the latter remains the highest-grossing Indian film when adjusted for inflation. The 1970s saw Kumar's career take a downturn, marked by three consecutive commercial underperformers, namely Dastaan (1972), Sagina (1974) and Bairaag (1976). In 1976, he went on a five-year hiatus from film performances and returned with the revolutionary drama Kranti, which was the highest-grossing Indian film of the year. He continued to play leading roles in films such as Shakti (1982), Karma (1986), and Saudagar (1991). His last on-screen appearance was in the commercially unsuccessful Qila (1998), which saw him in a dual role. Kumar later served as a member of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of India's parliament, from 2000 to 2006. Kumar's personal life was the subject of much media attention, however, he himself had largely avoided media limelight and endorsements. He was in a long-term relationship with actress and frequent co-star Madhubala that ended after the Naya Daur court case in 1957. He married actress Saira Banu in 1966 and resided in Bandra, a suburb of Mumbai, until his death in 2021. For his contributions to film, the Government of India awarded him with the Padma Bhushan in 1991 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2015, the country's third and second-highest civilian awards respectively. He was also awarded India's highest accolade in the field of cinema, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 1994. In 1998, the Government of Pakistan conferred Kumar with Nishan-e-Imtiaz, their highest civilian decoration, making him the only Indian to have received the honour. The house that Kumar grew up in, located in Peshawar, was declared a national heritage monument in 2014 by the Pakistani government.","[['was', 'Indian'], ['dominated movie scene from', 'late 1940s

97,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Queen_Victoria,Queen Victoria,"Victoria (Alexandrina Victoria; 24 May 1819 – 22 January 1901) was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 20 June 1837 until her death in 1901. Her reign of 63 years and seven months was longer than that of any previous British monarch and is known as the Victorian era. It was a period of industrial, political, scientific, and military change within the United Kingdom, and was marked by a great expansion of the British Empire. In 1876, the British Parliament voted to grant her the additional title of Empress of India. Victoria was the daughter of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn (the fourth son of King George III), and Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. After the deaths of her father and grandfather in 1820, she was raised under close supervision by her mother and her comptroller, John Conroy. She inherited the throne aged 18 after her father's three elder brothers died without surviving legitimate issue. Victoria, a constitutional monarch, attempted privately to influence government policy and ministerial appointments; publicly, she became a national icon who was identified with strict standards of personal morality. Victoria married her first cousin Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1840. Their children married into royal and noble families across the continent, earning Victoria the sobriquet ""the grandmother of Europe"" and spreading haemophilia in European royalty. After Albert's death in 1861, Victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances. As a result of her seclusion, British republicanism temporarily gained strength, but in the latter half of her reign, her popularity recovered. Her Golden and Diamond jubilees were times of public celebration. Victoria died in 1901 at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, at the age of 81. The last British monarch of the House of Hanover, she was succeeded by her son Edward VII of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.","[['is in', '1901'], ['was period of', 'industrial change within United Kingdom'], ['was period of', 'change'], ['was marked by', 'expansion'], ['was period of', 'change within United Kingdom'], ['was marked by', 'great expansion of British Empire'], ['was', 'period'], ['was marked by', 'expansion of British Empire'], ['was period of', 'industrial change'], ['was marked by', 'great expansion'], ['was daughter of', 'Duke'], ['was', 'daughter'], ['was daughter of', 'Duke of Kent'], ['was daughter of', 'Prince Edward'], ['mother', 'John Conroy'], ['was', 'After deaths of her father raised under close supervision by her mother'], ['was', 'After deaths raised under close supervision by her mother'], ['was', 'After deaths of her father in 1820 raised under supervision by her mother'], ['was raised by', 'her mother'], ['was', 'After deaths of her father raised by her mother'], ['was', 'After deaths raised under supervision by her mother'], ['was raised by', 'John Conroy'], ['was', 'After deaths in 1820 raised by her mother'], ['was', 'After deaths of her father in 1820 raised under close supervision by her mother'], ['was', 'After deaths of her father raised under supervision by her mother'], ['was', 'raised under supervision by her mother'], ['was', 'After deaths raised by her mother'], ['was', 'After deaths in 1820 raised under close supervision by her mother'], ['was', 'After deaths in 1820 raised under supervision by her mother'], ['was', 'After deaths of her father in 1820 raised by her mother'], ['was', 'raised under close supervision by her mother'], ['inherited', 'throne'], ['icon', 'identified with standards'], ['national icon', 'identified with standards of morality'], ['icon', 'identified with strict standards of morality'], ['national icon', 'identified with strict standards of personal morality'], ['publicly became', 'national icon'], ['icon', 'identified'], ['icon', 'identified with strict standards'], ['became', 'icon'], ['became', 'national icon'], ['national icon', 'identified with standards'], ['national icon', 'identified'], ['icon', 'identified with standards of morality'], ['privately influence', 'government policy'], ['influence', 'government policy'], ['publicly became', 'icon'], ['icon', 'identified with standards of personal morality'], ['icon', 'identified with strict standards of personal morality'], ['national icon', 'identified with strict standards'], ['national icon', 'identified with strict standards of morality'], ['national icon', 'identified with standards of personal morality'], ['married', 'her cousin'], ['married', 'her first cousin'], ['avoided', 'public appearances'], ['avoided', 'appearances'], ['plunged into', 'deep mourning'], ['plunged After', ""Albert 's death in 1861""], ['plunged After', ""Albert 's death""], ['plunged into', 'mourning'], ['died on', 'Isle of Wight'], ['died in', '1901'], ['died at', 'Osborne House'], ['died on', 'Isle'], ['died at', 'age'], ['died at', 'age of 81']]","[['within', 'industrial_change'], ['eraWithin', 'United_Kingdom'], ['by', 'expansion'], ['within', 'change'], ['of', 'great_expansion'], ['medalOf', 'British_Empire'], ['periodOf', 'expansion'], ['periodOf', 'industrial_change'], ['by', 'great_expansion'], ['daughterOf', 'Duke'], ['her', 'daughter'], ['duchessOf', 'Kent'], ['daughterOf', 'Prince_Edward'], ['motherConroy', 'John_Conroy'], ['by', 'deaths'], ['raisedBy', 'father'], ['by', 'close_supervision'], ['raisedBy', 'mother'], ['by', 'supervision'], ['raisedBy', 'John_Conroy'], ['inherited', 'throne'], ['identifiedWith', 'standards'], ['instituteOf', 'standards'], ['standardsOf', 'morality'], ['approvedOf', 'strict_standards'], ['standardsOf', 'personal_morality'], ['publiclyBecame', 'national_icon'], ['identifiedWith', 'strict_standards'], ['became', 'icon'], ['privatelyInfluence', 'government_policy'], ['influencePolicy', 'government_policy'], ['married', 'cousin'], ['married', 'first_cousin'], ['avoided', 'public_appearances'], ['avoided', 'appearances'], ['plungedInto', 'deep_mourning'], ['plungedAfter', ""Albert_'s_death""], ['diedOf', 'Isle'], ['isleOf', 'Wight'], ['diedAt', 'Osborne_House'], ['diedOn', 'Isle'], ['diedAt', 'age']]"

He is widely considered one of the most influential rappers of all time. Shakur is among the best-selling music artists, having sold more than 75 million records worldwide. Much of Shakur's music has been noted for addressing contemporary social issues that plagued inner cities, and he is considered a symbol of activism against inequality. Shakur was born in New York City to parents who were both political activists and Black Panther Party members. Raised by his mother, Afeni Shakur, he relocated to Baltimore in 1984 and to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1988. With the release of his debut album 2Pacalypse Now in 1991, he became a central figure in West Coast hip hop for his conscious rap lyrics. Shakur achieved further critical and commercial success with his follow-up albums Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z... (1993) and Me Against the World (1995). His Diamond certified album All Eyez on Me (1996), the first double-length album in hip-hop history, abandoned his introspective lyrics for volatile gangsta rap. In addition to his music career, Shakur also found considerable success as an actor, with his starring roles in Juice (1992), Poetic Justice (1993), Above the Rim (1994), Bullet (1996), Gridlock'd (1997), and Gang Related (1997). During the later part of his career, Shakur was shot five times in the lobby of a New York recording studio and experienced legal troubles, including incarceration. In 1995, Shakur served eight months in prison on sexual abuse charges, but was released pending an appeal of his conviction. Following his release, he signed to Marion ""Suge"" Knight's label Death Row Records and became heavily involved in the growing East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry. On September 7, 1996, Shakur was shot four times by an unidentified assailant in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas; he died six days later. Following his murder, Shakur's friend-turned-rival, the Notorious B.I.G., was at first considered a suspect due to their public feud, but was also murdered in another drive-by shooting six months later in March 1997 while visiting Los Angeles. Shakur's double-length posthumous album Greatest Hits (1998) is one of his two releases—and one of only nine hip hop albums—to have been certified Diamond in the United States. Five more albums have been released since Shakur's death, including his critically acclaimed posthumous album The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory (1996) under his stage name Makaveli, all of which have been certified Platinum in the United States. In 2002, Shakur was inducted into the Hip-Hop Hall of Fame. In 2017, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. Rolling Stone ranked Shakur among the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.","[['was', 'American'], ['is', 'considered'], ['is', 'widely considered'], ['is among', 'best selling music artists'], ['is

99,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Abraham_Lincoln,Abraham Lincoln,"Abraham Lincoln (/ˈlɪŋkən/ LINK-ən; February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was an American lawyer, politician, and statesman who served as the 16th president of the United States from 1861 until his assassination in 1865. Lincoln led the nation through the American Civil War and succeeded in preserving the Union, abolishing slavery, bolstering the federal government, and modernizing the U.S. economy. Lincoln was born into poverty in a log cabin in Kentucky and was raised on the frontier, primarily in Indiana. He was self-educated and became a lawyer, Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator, and U.S. Congressman from Illinois. In 1849, he returned to his successful law practice in central Illinois. In 1854, he was angered by the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which opened the territories to slavery, and he re-entered politics. He soon became a leader of the new Republican Party. He reached a national audience in the 1858 Senate campaign debates against Stephen A. Douglas. Lincoln ran for president in 1860, sweeping the North to gain victory. Pro-slavery elements in the South viewed his election as a threat to slavery, and Southern states began seceding from the Union. During this time, the newly formed Confederate States of America began seizing federal military bases in the south. Just over one month after Lincoln assumed the presidency, the Confederate States attacked Fort Sumter, a U.S. fort in South Carolina. Following the bombardment, Lincoln mobilized forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union. Lincoln, a moderate Republican, had to navigate a contentious array of factions with friends and opponents from both the Democratic and Republican parties. His allies, the War Democrats and the Radical Republicans, demanded harsh treatment of the Southern Confederates. Anti-war Democrats (called ""Copperheads"") despised Lincoln, and irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements plotted his assassination. He managed the factions by exploiting their mutual enmity, carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people. His Gettysburg Address came to be seen as one of the greatest and most influential statements of American national purpose. Lincoln closely supervised the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals, and implemented a naval blockade of the South's trade. He suspended habeas corpus in Maryland and elsewhere, and he averted British intervention by defusing the Trent Affair. In 1863, he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared the slaves in the states ""in rebellion"" to be free. It also directed the Army and Navy to ""recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons"" and to receive them ""into the armed service of the United States."" Lincoln also pressured border states to outlaw slavery, and he promoted the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which upon its ratification abolished slavery. Lincoln managed his own successful re-election campaign. He sought to heal the war-torn nation through reconciliation. On April 14, 1865, just five days after the war's end at Appomattox, he was attending a play at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., with his wife Mary when he was fatally shot by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth. Lincoln is remembered as a martyr and a national hero for his wartime leadership and for his efforts to preserve the Union and abolish slavery. Lincoln is often ranked in both popular and scholarly polls as the greatest president in American history.","[['was', 'American'], ['led', 'nation'], ['led nation through', 'American Civil War'], ['was raised in', 'primarily Indiana'], ['was born in', 'log cabin in Kentucky'], ['was', 'raised'], ['was', 'born into poverty in log cabin in Kentucky'], ['was born into', 'poverty'], ['was', 'born into poverty in log cabin'], ['was', 'born'], ['was raised on', 'frontier'], ['was born in', 'log cabin'], ['was', 'raised on frontier in Indiana'], ['was', 'raised on frontier primarily in Indiana'], ['was raised in', 'Indiana'], ['was educated', 'Whig Party leader'], ['was educated', 'Illinois state legislator'], ['was educated', 'lawyer'], ['returned In', '1849'], ['returned to', 'his law practice'], ['returned to', 'his law practice in Illinois'], ['returned to', 'his successful law practice in central Illinois'], ['returned to', 'his successful law practice in Illinois'], ['returned to', 'his law practice in central Illinois'], ['returned to', 'his successful law practice'], ['was', 'In 1854 angered by Kansas Nebraska Act'], ['re-entered', 'politics'], ['was angered by', 'Kansas Nebraska Act'], ['leader of', 'new Republican Party'], ['soon became', 'leader of new Republican Party'], ['soon became', 'leader of Republican Party'], ['became', 'leader of Republican Party'], ['became', 'leader of new Republican Party'], ['leader of', 'Republican Party'], ['soon became', 'leader'], ['became', 'leader'], ['reached', 'audience'], ['reached audience in', '1858 Senate campaign debates against Stephen A.

101,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great,Alexander the Great,"Alexander III of Macedon (Ancient Greek: Ἀλέξανδρος, romanized: Alexandros; 20/21 July 356 BC – 10/11 June 323 BC), commonly known as Alexander the Great, was a king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon. He succeeded his father Philip II to the throne in 336 BC at the age of 20, and spent most of his ruling years conducting a lengthy military campaign throughout Western Asia and Egypt. By the age of thirty, he had created one of the largest empires in history, stretching from Greece to northwestern India. He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered to be one of history's greatest and most successful military commanders. Until the age of 16, Alexander was tutored by Aristotle. In 335 BC, shortly after his assumption of kingship over Macedon, he campaigned in the Balkans and reasserted control over Thrace and Illyria before marching on the city of Thebes, which was subsequently destroyed in battle. Alexander then led the League of Corinth, and used his authority to launch the pan-Hellenic project envisaged by his father, assuming leadership over all Greeks in their conquest of Persia. In 334 BC, he invaded the Achaemenid Persian Empire and began a series of campaigns that lasted for 10 years. Following his conquest of Asia Minor, Alexander broke the power of Achaemenid Persia in a series of decisive battles, including those at Issus and Gaugamela; he subsequently overthrew Darius III and conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety. After the fall of Persia, the Macedonian Empire held a vast swath of territory between the Adriatic Sea and the Indus River. Alexander endeavored to reach the ""ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea"" and invaded India in 326 BC, achieving an important victory over Porus, an ancient Indian king of present-day Punjab, at the Battle of the Hydaspes. Due to the demand of his homesick troops, he eventually turned back at the Beas River and later died in 323 BC in Babylon, the city of Mesopotamia that he had planned to establish as his empire's capital. Alexander's death left unexecuted an additional series of planned military and mercantile campaigns that would have begun with a Greek invasion of Arabia. In the years following his death, a series of civil wars broke out across the Macedonian Empire, eventually leading to its disintegration at the hands of the Diadochi. With his death marking the start of the Hellenistic period, Alexander's legacy includes the cultural diffusion and syncretism that his conquests engendered, such as Greco-Buddhism and Hellenistic Judaism. He founded more than twenty cities that bore his name, with the most prominent being the city of Alexandria in Egypt. Alexander's settlement of Greek colonists and the resulting spread of Greek culture led to the overwhelming dominance of Hellenistic civilization and influence as far east as the Indian subcontinent. The Hellenistic period developed through the Roman Empire into modern Western culture; the Greek language became the lingua franca of the region and was the predominant language of the Byzantine Empire up until its collapse in the mid-15th century AD. Greek-speaking communities in central Anatolia and in far-eastern Anatolia survived until the Greek genocide of the 1910s and early 1920s as well as the Greek–Turkish population exchange of the mid-1920s. Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mould of Achilles, featuring prominently in the historical and mythical traditions of both Greek and non-Greek cultures. His military achievements and unprecedented enduring successes in battle made him the measure against which many later military leaders would compare themselves, and his tactics remain a significant subject of study in military academies worldwide.","[['was', 'king'], ['succeeded', 'his father'], ['is widely considered', ""to one history 's military commanders""], ['is', 'considered'], ['is

102,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Kristen_Stewart,Kristen Stewart,"Kristen Jaymes Stewart (born April 9, 1990) is an American actress. The world's highest-paid actress in 2012, she has received various accolades, including a British Academy Film Award and a César Award, in addition to nominations for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award. Born and raised in Los Angeles to parents who both worked in the entertainment industry, Stewart first gained notice at age 12 for her role as the daughter of Jodie Foster's character in David Fincher's thriller Panic Room (2002), which earned her a Young Artist Award nomination. She subsequently starred in Speak (2004), Catch That Kid (2004), Zathura: A Space Adventure (2005), and Into the Wild (2007). She went on to achieve global stardom for her role as Bella Swan in The Twilight Saga film series (2008–2012), which ranks among the highest-grossing film franchises; for the role, she was awarded the BAFTA Rising Star Award in 2010. After starring in the fantasy film Snow White and the Huntsman (2012), Stewart eschewed roles in big-budget films in favor of independent productions in the years following. She took on roles in the dramas Camp X-Ray (2014) and Still Alice (2014), and the science fiction romance Equals (2016). In 2015, she was acclaimed for her performance in Olivier Assayas' drama film Clouds of Sils Maria, which won her the César Award for Best Supporting Actress. Stewart reunited with Assayas the following year in the supernatural thriller Personal Shopper (2016) and made her directorial debut with the short film Come Swim (2017). She returned to mainstream Hollywood with leading roles in the action film Charlie's Angels (2019) and the romantic comedy film Happiest Season (2020). Stewart's portrayal of Diana, Princess of Wales in Pablo Larraín's biographical drama Spencer (2021) earned her widespread critical acclaim and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.","[['is', 'American'], ['has received', 'accolades'], ['has received', 'various accolades including British Academy Film Award'], ['has received accolades in', 'nominations for Academy

103,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Google,Google,"Google LLC (/ˈɡuːɡəl/) is an American multinational technology company focusing on search engine technology, online advertising, cloud computing, computer software, quantum computing, e-commerce, artificial intelligence, and consumer electronics. It has been referred to as ""the most powerful company in the world"" and one of the world's most valuable brands due to its market dominance, data collection, and technological advantages in the area of artificial intelligence. Its parent company Alphabet is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft. Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were PhD students at Stanford University in California. Together they own about 14% of its publicly listed shares and control 56% of the stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's Internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet. The company has since rapidly grown to offer a multitude of products and services beyond Google Search, many of which hold dominant market positions. These products address a wide range of use cases, including email (Gmail), navigation (Waze & Maps), cloud computing (Cloud), web browsing (Chrome), video sharing (YouTube), productivity (Workspace), operating systems (Android), cloud storage (Drive), language translation (Translate), photo storage (Photos), video calling (Meet), smart home (Nest), smartphones (Pixel), wearable technology (Pixel Watch & Fitbit), music streaming (YouTube Music), video on demand (YouTube TV), artificial intelligence (Google Assistant), machine learning APIs (TensorFlow), AI chips (TPU), and more. Discontinued Google products include gaming (Stadia), Glass, Google+, Reader, Play Music, Nexus, Hangouts, and Inbox by Gmail. Google's other ventures outside of Internet services and consumer electronics include quantum computing (Sycamore), self-driving cars (Waymo, formerly the Google Self-Driving Car Project), smart cities (Sidewalk Labs), and transformer models (Google Brain). Google and YouTube are the two most visited websites worldwide followed by Facebook and Twitter. Google is also the largest search engine, mapping and navigation application, email provider, office suite, video sharing platform, photo and cloud storage provider, mobile operating system, web browser, ML framework, and AI virtual assistant provider in the world as measured by market share. On the list of most valuable brands, Google is ranked second by Forbes and fourth by Interbrand. It has received significant criticism involving issues such as privacy concerns, , censorship, search neutrality, antitrust and abuse of its monopoly position.","[['is', 'multinational technology

104,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Albert_Einstein,Albert Einstein,"Albert Einstein (/ˈaɪnstaɪn/ EYEN-styne; German: [ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn]; 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are the two pillars of modern physics. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed ""the world's most famous equation"". His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics ""for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect"", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in ""Einstein"" becoming synonymous with ""genius"". In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers. These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and demonstrated mass-energy equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. However, for much of the later part of his career, he worked on two ultimately unsuccessful endeavors. First, despite his great contributions to quantum mechanics, he opposed what it evolved into, objecting that ""God does not play dice"". Second, he attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism. As a result, he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of modern physics. Einstein was born in the German Empire, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the Kingdom of Württemberg) the following year. In 1897, at the age of 17, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Zürich, graduating in 1900. In 1901, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life, and in 1903 he secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich. In 1914, Einstein moved to Berlin in order to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin. In 1917, Einstein became director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics; he also became a German citizen again, this time Prussian. In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Einstein, as a Jew, objected to the policies of the newly elected Nazi government; he settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research. Einstein supported the Allies but generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons.","[['was', 'born acknowledged'], ['received', '1921 Nobel Prize'], ['received', '1921 Nobel Prize in Physics'],

105,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/President_of_the_United_States,President of the United States,"The president of the United States (POTUS) is the head of state and head of government of the United States of America. The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. The power of the presidency has grown substantially since the first president, George Washington, took office in 1789. While presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasingly strong role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, with a notable expansion during the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt. In contemporary times, the president is also looked upon as one of the world's most powerful political figures as the leader of the only remaining global superpower. As the leader of the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP, the president possesses significant domestic and international hard and soft power. Article II of the Constitution establishes the executive branch of the federal government and vests the executive power in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers. Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy. The role includes responsibility for directing the world's most expensive military, which has the second largest nuclear arsenal. The president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. As part of the system of checks and balances, Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or veto federal legislation. Since modern presidents are also typically viewed as the leaders of their political parties, major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections, with presidents taking an active role in promoting their policy priorities to members of Congress who are often electorally dependent on the president. In recent decades, presidents have also made increasing use of executive orders, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to shape domestic policy. The president is elected indirectly through the Electoral College to a four-year term, along with the vice president. Under the Twenty-second Amendment, ratified in 1951, no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may be elected to a third. In addition, nine vice presidents have become president by virtue of a president's intra-term death or resignation. In all, 45 individuals have served 46 presidencies spanning 58 full four-year terms. Joe Biden is the 46th and current president of the United States, having assumed office on January 20, 2021.","[['head of', 'government of United States of America'], ['is head of', 'state'], ['head

Recognised as both a film and fashion icon, she was ranked by the American Film Institute as the third-greatest female screen legend from the Classical Hollywood cinema and was inducted into the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame. Born in Ixelles, Brussels, to an aristocratic family, Hepburn spent parts of her childhood in Belgium, England, and the Netherlands. She studied ballet with Sonia Gaskell in Amsterdam beginning in 1945, and with Marie Rambert in London from 1948. She began performing as a chorus girl in West End musical theatre productions and then had minor appearances in several films. She rose to stardom in the romantic comedy Roman Holiday (1953) alongside Gregory Peck, for which she was the first actress to win an Oscar, a Golden Globe Award, and a BAFTA Award for a single performance. That year, she also won a Tony Award for Best Lead Actress in a Play for her performance in Ondine. She went on to star in a number of successful films such as Sabrina (1954), in which Humphrey Bogart and William Holden compete for her affection; Funny Face (1957), a musical where she sang her own parts; the drama The Nun's Story (1959); the romantic comedy Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961); the thriller-romance Charade (1963), opposite Cary Grant; and the musical My Fair Lady (1964). In 1967 she starred in the thriller Wait Until Dark, receiving Academy Award, Golden Globe, and BAFTA nominations. After that, she only occasionally appeared in films, one being Robin and Marian (1976) with Sean Connery. Her last recorded performances were in the 1990 documentary television series Gardens of the World with Audrey Hepburn for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement – Informational Programming. Hepburn won three BAFTA Awards for Best British Actress in a Leading Role. In recognition of her film career, she received BAFTA's Lifetime Achievement Award, the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award, the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award, and the Special Tony Award. She remains one of only seventeen people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards.

112,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Jennifer_Lawrence,Jennifer Lawrence,"Jennifer Shrader Lawrence (born August 15, 1990) is an American actress. The world's highest-paid actress in 2015 and 2016, her films have grossed over $6 billion worldwide to date. She appeared in Time's 100 most influential people in the world list in 2013 and the Forbes Celebrity 100 list from 2013 to 2016. During her childhood, Lawrence performed in church plays and school musicals. At age fourteen, she was spotted by a talent scout while vacationing in New York City with her family. She moved to Los Angeles and began her acting career with guest roles on television. Her first major role was as a main cast member on the sitcom The Bill Engvall Show (2007–2009). She made her film debut with a supporting role in the drama Garden Party (2008), and had her breakthrough playing a poverty-stricken teenager in the independent mystery drama Winter's Bone (2010). Lawrence's career progressed with starring roles as the mutant Mystique in the X-Men film series (2011–2019) and Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games film series (2012–2015). The latter made her the highest-grossing action heroine of all time. Lawrence received various accolades for her three collaborations with filmmaker David O. Russell. Her performance as a troubled young widow in the romance film Silver Linings Playbook (2012) won her the Academy Award for Best Actress, making her the second-youngest winner in the category at age 22. She won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for playing an unpredictable wife in the black comedy American Hustle (2013). Lawrence also received Golden Globe Awards for both of these films, and for her portrayal of businesswoman Joy Mangano in the biopic Joy (2015). A series of mixed reviewed films and the media scrutiny of her role choices led to a small break from acting. She returned with the streaming films Don't Look Up (2021) and Causeway (2022). Lawrence identifies as a feminist and advocates for women's reproductive rights. In 2015, she founded the Jennifer Lawrence Foundation, which advocates for the Boys & Girls Clubs of America and the Special Olympics. She formed the production company Excellent Cadaver in 2018.

113,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Adolf_Hitler,Adolf Hitler,"Adolf Hitler (German: [ˈadoːlf ˈhɪt.lɐ]; 20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was an Austrian-born German politician who was dictator of Germany from 1933 until his death in 1945. He rose to power as the leader of the Nazi Party, becoming the chancellor in 1933 and then taking the title of Führer und Reichskanzler in 1934. During his dictatorship, he initiated World War II in Europe by invading Poland on 1 September 1939. He was closely involved in military operations throughout the war and was central to the perpetration of the Holocaust: the genocide of about six million Jews and millions of other victims. Hitler was born in Braunau am Inn in Austria-Hungary and was raised near Linz. He lived in Vienna later in the first decade of the 1900s and moved to Germany in 1913. He was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I. In 1919, he joined the German Workers' Party (DAP), the precursor of the Nazi Party, and was appointed leader of the Nazi Party in 1921. In 1923, he attempted to seize governmental power in a failed coup in Munich and was imprisoned with a sentence of five years. In jail, he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf (""My Struggle""). After his early release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting pan-Germanism, anti-Semitism and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. He frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as part of a Jewish conspiracy. By November 1932, the Nazi Party held the most seats in the German Reichstag, but did not have a majority. As a result, no party was able to form a majority parliamentary coalition in support of a candidate for chancellor. The former chancellor Franz von Papen and other conservative leaders persuaded President Paul von Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as chancellor on 30 January 1933. Shortly after, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act of 1933 which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany, a one-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of Nazism. On 2 August 1934, Hindenburg died and Hitler replaced him as the head of state and government. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the abrogation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories inhabited by millions of ethnic Germans, which initially gave him significant popular support. Hitler sought Lebensraum (lit. 'living space') for the German people in Eastern Europe, and his aggressive foreign policy is considered the primary cause of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and, on 1 September 1939, invaded Poland, resulting in Britain and France declaring war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. In December 1941, he declared war on the United States. By the end of 1941, German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa. These gains were gradually reversed after 1941, and in 1945 the Allied armies defeated the German army. On 29 April 1945, he married his longtime lover, Eva Braun, in the Führerbunker in Berlin. Less than two days later, the couple committed suicide to avoid capture by the Soviet Red Army. Their corpses were burned as Hitler had commanded. The historian and biographer Ian Kershaw describes Hitler as ""the embodiment of modern political evil"". Under Hitler's leadership and racist ideology, the Nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of about six million Jews and millions of other victims, whom he and his followers deemed Untermenschen (subhumans) or socially undesirable. Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 28.7 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European theatre. The number of civilians killed during World War II was unprecedented in warfare, and the casualties constitute the deadliest conflict in history.","[['was', 'German'], ['was', 'born'], ['becoming',

After signing with Def Jam in 2005, she soon gained recognition with the release of her first two studio albums, Music of the Sun (2005) and A Girl Like Me (2006), both of which were influenced by Caribbean music and peaked within the top ten of the US Billboard 200 chart. Rihanna's third album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), incorporated elements of dance-pop and established her status as a sex symbol in the music industry. The chart-topping single ""Umbrella"" earned Rihanna her first Grammy Award and catapulted her to global stardom. She continued to mix pop, dance, and R&B genres on her next studio albums, Rated R (2009), Loud (2010), Talk That Talk (2011), and Unapologetic (2012), the latter of which became her first Billboard 200 number one.

116,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Bruce_Lee,Bruce Lee,"Bruce Lee (Chinese: 李小龍; born Lee Jun-fan, 李振藩; November 27, 1940 – July 20, 1973) was a Hong Kong and American martial artist and actor. He was the founder of Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts philosophy drawing from different combat disciplines that is often credited with paving the way for modern mixed martial arts (MMA). Lee is considered by critics, media, and other martial artists to be the most influential martial artist of all time and a pop culture icon of the 20th century, who bridged the gap between East and West. He is credited with promoting Hong Kong action cinema and helping to change the way Asians were presented in American films. Born in San Francisco and raised in British Hong Kong, Lee was introduced to the Hong Kong film industry as a child actor by his father. However, these were not martial arts films. His early martial arts experience included Wing Chun (trained under Yip Man), tai chi, boxing (winning a Hong Kong boxing tournament), and apparently frequent street fighting (neighbourhood and rooftop fights). In 1959, Lee, having U.S. citizenship due to his birth, was able to move to Seattle. In 1961, he enrolled in the University of Washington. It was during this time in the United States that he began considering making money by teaching martial arts even though he aspired to an acting career. He opened his first martial arts school, operated out of home in Seattle. After later adding a second school in Oakland, California, he once drew significant attention at the 1964 Long Beach International Karate Championships of California by making demonstrations and speaking. He subsequently moved to Los Angeles to teach, where his students included Chuck Norris, Sharon Tate, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. In the 1970s, his Hong Kong and Hollywood-produced films elevated the Hong Kong martial arts films to a new level of popularity and acclaim, sparking a surge of Western interest in Chinese martial arts. The direction and tone of his films dramatically influenced and changed martial arts and martial arts films worldwide. He is noted for his roles in five feature-length Hong Kong martial arts films in the early 1970s: Lo Wei's The Big Boss (1971) and Fist of Fury (1972); Golden Harvest's Way of the Dragon (1972), directed and written by Lee; and Golden Harvest and Warner Brothers' Enter the Dragon (1973) and The Game of Death (1978), both directed by Robert Clouse. Lee became an iconic figure known throughout the world, particularly among the Chinese, based upon his portrayal of Chinese nationalism in his films, and among Asian Americans for defying Asian stereotypes. Having initially learnt Wing Chun, tai chi, boxing, and street fighting, he combined them with other influences from various sources into the spirit of his personal martial arts philosophy, which he dubbed Jeet Kune Do (The Way of the Intercepting Fist). Lee died on July 20, 1973, at the age of 32. Since his death, Lee has continued to be a prominent influence on modern combat sports, including judo, karate, mixed martial arts, and boxing, as well as modern popular culture, including film, television, comics, animation and video games. Time named Lee one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century.","[['was', 'founder'], ['was founder of', 'Jeet Kune'], ['is considered by', 'critics'], ['be influential artist of', 'time'],

117,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Jennifer_Lopez,Jennifer Lopez,"Jennifer Lynn Affleck (née Lopez; born July 24, 1969), also known as J.Lo, is an American singer, actress and dancer. In 1991, she began appearing as a Fly Girl dancer on the sketch comedy television series In Living Color, where she remained a regular until she decided to pursue an acting career in 1993. For her first leading role in Selena (1997), she became the first Hispanic actress to earn over US$1 million for a film. She went on to star in Anaconda (1997) and Out of Sight (1998), and established herself as the highest-paid Hispanic actress in Hollywood. Lopez ventured into the music industry with her debut studio album On the 6 (1999), which helped propel the Latin pop movement in American music, and later starred in the psychological horror The Cell (2000). With the simultaneous release of her second studio album J.Lo and her romantic comedy The Wedding Planner in 2001, she became the first woman to have a number-one album and film in the same week. Her 2002 release, J to tha L–O! The Remixes, became the first remix album in history to debut atop the US Billboard 200. Later that year, she released her third studio album, This Is Me... Then and starred in the film Maid in Manhattan. After starring in Gigli (2003), a critical and commercial failure, Lopez starred in the successful romantic comedies Shall We Dance? (2004) and Monster-in-Law (2005). Her fifth studio album, Como Ama una Mujer (2007), had the highest first week sales for a debut Spanish album in the United States. Following a relatively unsuccessful period, she returned to prominence in 2011 with her appearance as a judge on American Idol and released her seventh studio album, Love?. From 2016 to 2018, she starred in the police drama series Shades of Blue and performed a residency show, Jennifer Lopez: All I Have, at Planet Hollywood Las Vegas. She also produced and served as a judge on World of Dance (2017–2020). In 2019, she garnered critical acclaim for her performance as a stripper in the crime drama Hustlers. Lopez is considered a pop culture icon, and is often described as a triple threat entertainer. With a cumulative film gross of US$3.1 billion and estimated global sales of 80 million records, she is considered the most influential Hispanic entertainer in North America. In 2012, Forbes ranked her the world's most powerful celebrity, and the 38th most powerful woman in the world. Time listed her among their 100 most influential people in the world in 2018. Her most successful singles on the US Billboard Hot 100 include ""If You Had My Love"", ""I'm Real"", ""Ain't It Funny"", ""All I Have"" and ""On the Floor"". For her contributions to the recording industry, she has a landmark star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and has received the Billboard Icon Award and the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award, among other honors. Her other ventures include beauty and clothing lines, fragrances, a production company and a charitable foundation.","[['appearing as', 'Fly Girl dancer'], ['began', 'appearing as Fly Girl dancer'],

118,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Australia,Australia,"Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands. With an area of 7,617,930 square kilometres (2,941,300 sq mi), Australia is the largest country by area in Oceania and the world's sixth-largest country. Australia is the oldest, flattest, and driest inhabited continent, with the least fertile soils. It is a megadiverse country, and its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes and climates, with deserts in the centre, tropical rainforests in the north-east, and mountain ranges in the south-east. The ancestors of Aboriginal Australians began arriving from south east Asia approximately 65,000 years ago, during the last ice age. Arriving by sea, they settled the continent and had formed approximately 250 distinct language groups by the time of European settlement, maintaining some of the longest known continuing artistic and religious traditions in the world. Australia's written history commenced with the European maritime exploration of Australia. The Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon was the first known European to reach Australia, in 1606. In 1770, the British explorer James Cook mapped and claimed the east coast of Australia for Great Britain, and the First Fleet of British ships arrived at Sydney in 1788 to establish the penal colony of New South Wales. The European population grew in subsequent decades, and by the end of the 1850s gold rush, most of the continent had been explored by European settlers and an additional five self-governing British colonies established. Democratic parliaments were gradually established through the 19th century, culminating with a vote for the federation of the six colonies and foundation of the Commonwealth of Australia on 1 January 1901. Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system and wealthy market economy. Politically, Australia is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy, comprising six states and ten territories. Australia's population of nearly 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard. Canberra is the nation's capital, while its most populous city and financial centre is Sydney. The next four largest cities are Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide. Australia's demography has been shaped by centuries of immigration: immigrants account for 30% of the country's population, and almost half of Australians have at least one parent born overseas. Australia's abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade relations are crucial to the country's economy, which generates its income from various sources including services, mining exports, banking, manufacturing, agriculture and international education. Australia is a highly developed country with a high-income economy. As of 2022, it was the world's fourteenth-largest economy with the ninth-highest per capita income. In 2017, it ranked as fifth-highest Human Development Index. Australia is a regional power, and has the world's thirteenth-highest military expenditure. Australia ranks amongst the highest in the world for quality of life, democracy, health, education, economic freedom, civil liberties, safety, and political rights, with all its major cities faring exceptionally in global comparative livability surveys.

119,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Soviet_Union,Soviet Union,"The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), was a transcontinental country that spanned much of Eurasia from 1922 to 1991. A flagship communist state, it was nominally a federal union of fifteen national republics; in practice, both its government and its economy were highly centralized until its final years. It was a one-party state governed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, with the city of Moscow serving as its capital as well as that of its largest and most populous republic: the Russian SFSR. Other major cities included Leningrad (Russian SFSR), Kiev (Ukrainian SSR), Minsk (Byelorussian SSR), Tashkent (Uzbek SSR), Alma-Ata (Kazakh SSR), and Novosibirsk (Russian SFSR). It was the largest country in the world, covering over 22,402,200 square kilometres (8,649,500 sq mi) and spanning eleven time zones. The country's roots lay in the October Revolution of 1917, when the Bolsheviks, under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the Russian Provisional Government that had earlier replaced the House of Romanov of the Russian Empire. The Bolshevik coup led to the establishment of the Russian Soviet Republic, the world's first constitutionally guaranteed socialist state. Persisting internal tensions escalated into the Russian Civil War. By 1922 the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin had emerged victorious, forming the Soviet Union. Following Lenin's death in 1924, Joseph Stalin came to power. Stalin inaugurated a period of rapid industrialization and forced collectivization that led to significant economic growth, but also contributed to a famine in 1930–1933 that killed millions. The labour camp system of the Gulag was also expanded in this period. Stalin conducted the Great Purge to remove his actual and perceived opponents. After the outbreak of World War II, Germany invaded the Soviet Union. The combined Soviet civilian and military casualty count—estimated to be around 27 million people—accounted for the majority of losses of Allied forces. In the aftermath of World War II, the territory taken by the Red Army formed various Soviet satellite states. The beginning of the Cold War saw the Eastern Bloc of the Soviet Union confront the Western Bloc of the United States, with the latter grouping becoming largely united in 1949 under NATO and the former grouping becoming largely united in 1955 under the Warsaw Pact. Following Stalin's death in 1953, a period known as de-Stalinization occurred under the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev. The Soviets took an early lead in the Space Race with the first artificial satellite, the first human spaceflight, and the first probe to land on another planet (Venus). In the 1970s, there was a brief détente in the Soviet Union's relationship with the United States, but tensions resumed following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. In the mid-1980s, the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, sought to reform the country through his policies of glasnost and perestroika. In 1989, during the closing stages of the Cold War, various countries of the Warsaw Pact overthrew their Marxist–Leninist regimes, which was accompanied by the outbreak of strong nationalist and separatist movements across the entire Soviet Union. In 1991, Gorbachev initiated a national referendum—boycotted by the Soviet republics of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Armenia, Georgia, and Moldova—that resulted in the majority of participating citizens voting in favour of preserving the country as a renewed federation. In August 1991, hardline members of the Communist Party staged a coup d'état against Gorbachev; the attempt failed, with Boris Yeltsin playing a high-profile role in facing down the unrest, and the Communist Party was subsequently banned. All of the republics emerged from the dissolution of the Soviet Union as fully independent post-Soviet states. The Soviet Union produced many significant social and technological achievements and innovations. It had the world's second-largest economy, and the Soviet Armed Forces comprised the largest standing military in the world. An NPT-designated state, it possessed the largest arsenal of nuclear weapons in the world. It was a founding member of the United Nations as well as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. Before the dissolution, the country had maintained its status as one of the world's two superpowers through its hegemony in Eastern Europe, military and economic strengths, aid to developing countries, and scientific research.","[['was', 'transcontinental country'], ['was', 'transcontinental'], ['was', 'country'], ['Union of', 'Soviet Socialist Republics'], ['was federal union of',

120,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Android_(operating_system),Android (operating system),"Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open-source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance and commercially sponsored by Google. It was unveiled in November 2007, with the first commercial Android device, the HTC Dream, being launched in September 2008. Most versions of Android are proprietary. The core components are taken from the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), which is free and open-source software (FOSS) primarily licensed under the Apache License. When Android is installed on devices, ability to modify the otherwise FOSS software is usually restricted, either by not providing the corresponding source code or preventing reinstallation through technical measures, rendering the installed version proprietary. Most Android devices ship with additional proprietary software pre-installed, most notably Google Mobile Services (GMS) which includes core apps such as Google Chrome, the digital distribution platform Google Play, and associated Google Play Services development platform. Over 70 percent of Android smartphones run Google's ecosystem; some with vendor-customized user interface and software suite, such as TouchWiz and later One UI by Samsung, and HTC Sense. Competing Android ecosystems and forks include Fire OS (developed by Amazon), ColorOS by OPPO, OriginOS by vivo and MagicUI by Honor, or custom ROMs such as LineageOS. However, the ""Android"" name and logo are trademarks of Google which imposes standards to restrict the use of Android branding by ""uncertified"" devices outside their ecosystem. The source code has been used to develop variants of Android on a range of other electronics, such as game consoles, digital cameras, portable media players, PCs, each with a specialized user interface. Some well known derivatives include Android TV for televisions and Wear OS for wearables, both developed by Google. Software packages on Android, which use the APK format, are generally distributed through proprietary application stores like Google Play Store, Amazon Appstore (including for Windows 11), Samsung Galaxy Store, Huawei AppGallery, Cafe Bazaar, and GetJar, or open source platforms like Aptoide or F-Droid. Android has been the best-selling OS worldwide on smartphones since 2011 and on tablets since 2013. As of May 2021, it has over three billion monthly active users, the largest installed base of any operating system, and as of January 2021, the Google Play Store features over 3 million apps. Android 13, released on August 15, 2022, is the latest version, and the recently released Android 12.1/12L includes improvements specific for foldable phones, tablets, desktop-sized screens and Chromebooks.","[['is', 'mobile operating system'], ['is', 'operating system'], ['is mobile', 'version'], ['is developed by', 'consortium'], ['is developed by', 'consortium of developers'], ['was',

121,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Taiwan,Taiwan,"Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), is a country in East Asia, at the junction of the East and South China Seas in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, with the People's Republic of China (PRC) to the northwest, Japan to the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. The territories controlled by the ROC consist of 168 islands, with a combined area of 36,193 square kilometres (13,974 sq mi). The main island of Taiwan, also known as Formosa, has an area of 35,808 square kilometres (13,826 sq mi), with mountain ranges dominating the eastern two-thirds and plains in the western third, where its highly urbanised population is concentrated. The capital, Taipei, forms along with New Taipei City and Keelung the largest metropolitan area of Taiwan. Other major cities include Taoyuan, Taichung, Tainan, and Kaohsiung. With around 23.9 million inhabitants, Taiwan is among the most densely populated countries in the world. Taiwan has been settled for at least 25,000 years. Ancestors of Taiwanese indigenous peoples settled the island around 6,000 years ago. In the 17th century, large-scale Han Chinese (specifically the Hakkas and Hoklos) immigration to western Taiwan began under a Dutch colony and continued under the Kingdom of Tungning. The island was annexed in 1683 by the Qing dynasty of China and ceded to the Empire of Japan in 1895. The Republic of China, which had overthrown the Qing in 1911, took control of Taiwan on behalf of the Allies of World War II following the surrender of Japan in 1945. The immediate resumption of the Chinese Civil War resulted in the loss of the Chinese mainland to Communist forces who established the People's Republic of China, and the flight of the ROC central government to Taiwan in 1949. The effective jurisdiction of the ROC has since been limited to Formosa, Penghu, and smaller islands. In the early 1960s, Taiwan entered a period of rapid economic growth and industrialisation called the ""Taiwan Miracle"". In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the ROC transitioned from a one-party military dictatorship to a multi-party democracy with democratically elected presidents since 1996. Taiwan's export-oriented industrial economy is the 21st-largest in the world by nominal GDP and 19th-largest by PPP measures, with a focus on steel, machinery, electronics and chemicals manufacturing. Taiwan is a developed country, ranking 20th on GDP per capita. It is ranked highly in terms of civil liberties, healthcare, and human development. The political status of Taiwan is contentious. The ROC no longer represents China as a member of the United Nations, after UN members voted in 1971 to recognize the PRC instead. The ROC maintained its claim of being the sole legitimate representative of China and its territory, although this has been downplayed since its democratization in the 1990s. Taiwan is claimed by the PRC, which refuses diplomatic relations with countries that recognise the ROC. Taiwan maintains official diplomatic relations with 13 out of 193 UN member states and the Holy See, though many others maintain unofficial diplomatic ties through representative offices and institutions that function as de facto embassies and consulates. International organisations in which the PRC participates either refuse to grant membership to Taiwan or allow it to participate only on a non-state basis under various names. Domestically, the major political contention is between parties favouring eventual Chinese unification and promoting a pan-Chinese identity, contrasted with those aspiring to formal international recognition and promoting a Taiwanese identity; into the 21st century, both sides have moderated their positions to broaden their appeal.","[['with', 'Republic of China'], ['is country in', 'East

122,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Aaliyah,Aaliyah,"Aaliyah Dana Haughton (/ɑːˈliːə/; January 16, 1979 – August 25, 2001) was an American singer and actress. She has been credited for helping to redefine contemporary R&B, pop and hip hop, earning her the nicknames the ""Princess of R&B"" and ""Queen of Urban Pop"". Born in Brooklyn but raised in Detroit, she first gained recognition at the age of 10, when she appeared on the television show Star Search and performed in concert alongside Gladys Knight. At the age of 12, Aaliyah signed with Jive Records and her uncle Barry Hankerson's Blackground Records. Hankerson introduced her to R. Kelly, who became her mentor, as well as lead songwriter and producer of her debut album, Age Ain't Nothing but a Number. The album sold three million copies in the United States and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). After allegations of an illegal marriage with Kelly, Aaliyah ended her contract with Jive and signed with Atlantic Records. Aaliyah worked with record producers Timbaland and Missy Elliott for her second album, One in a Million, which sold three million copies in the United States and more than eight million copies worldwide. In 2000, Aaliyah appeared in her first film, Romeo Must Die. She contributed to the film's soundtrack, which spawned the single ""Try Again"". The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 solely on airplay, making Aaliyah the first artist in Billboard history to achieve this goal. After completing Romeo Must Die, Aaliyah filmed her role in Queen of the Damned, and released, in 2001, her self-titled third and final studio album, which topped the Billboard 200. On August 25, 2001, Aaliyah died at the age of 22 in an airplane accident in the Bahamas, when the overloaded aircraft she was traveling in crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all nine on board. The pilot was later found to have traces of cocaine and alcohol in his body and was not qualified to fly the aircraft designated for the flight. Aaliyah's family later filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the aircraft's operator, Blackhawk International Airways, which was settled out of court. In the decades since her death, Aaliyah's music has continued to achieve commercial success, aided by several posthumous releases. She has sold 8.1 million albums in the US and an estimated 24 to 32 million albums worldwide. Billboard lists her as the tenth most successful female R&B artist of the past 25 years, and the 27th most successful in history. Her accolades include three American Music Awards and two MTV VMAs, along with five Grammy Award nominations.","[['was', 'American'], ['has', 'has credited'], ['gained recognition at', 'age of 10'], ['first gained', 'recognition'], ['first gained recognition at', 'age'], ['first gained recognition at', 'age of 10'], ['gained recognition at', 'age'], ['performed alongside', 'Gladys Knight'], ['gained', 'recognition'], ['performed in', 'concert'], ['appeared on', 'television show Star Search'], ['signed At', 'age of 12'], ['signed with', 'Jive Records'], ['signed At', 'age'], ['worked for', 'her album'], ['worked for', 'her second album'], ['worked with', 'record producers Timbaland'], ['worked for', 'One in Million'], ['album', 'One in Million'], ['appeared in', 'her film'], ['appeared In', '2000'], ['appeared in', 'her first film'], ['contributed to', ""film 's soundtrack""], ['first artist in', 'Billboard history'], ['artist in', 'Billboard history'], ['filmed', 'her role in Queen'], ['filmed', 'her role in Queen of Damned'], ['filmed', 'her role'], ['released in', '2001'], ['died On', 'August 25 2001'], ['died at', 'age of 22'], ['died at', 'age'], ['died in', 'airplane accident in Bahamas'], ['died in', 'airplane accident'], ['has', 'family'], ['has', 'music'], ['has sold', '8.1 million albums']]","[['diedAt', 'age'], ['firstGained', 'recognition'], ['performedAlongside', 'Gladys_Knight'], ['performedIn', 'concert'], ['appeared', 'television_show_Star_Search'], ['diedAt', 'age'], ['signedWith', 'Jive_Records'], ['workedFor', 'album'], ['workedFor', 'second_album'], ['workedWith', 'record_producers'], ['appearedIn', 'film'], ['appearedIn', 'first_film'], ['contributed', ""film_'s_soundtrack""], ['firstIn', 'Billboard_history'], ['filmedIn', 'role'], ['appearedIn', 'Queen'], ['spokeOf', 'role'], ['roleOf', 'Queen'], ['queenOf', 'Damned'], ['filmed', 'role'], ['diedOn', 'August'], ['diedIn', 'airplane_accident'], ['diedIn', 'Bahamas'], ['has', 'family'], ['has', 'music'], ['sold', '8.1_million_albums']]"

124,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/John_F._Kennedy,John F. Kennedy,"John Fitzgerald Kennedy (May 29, 1917 – November 22, 1963), often referred to by his initials JFK and the nickname Jack, was an American politician who served as the 35th president of the United States from 1961 until his assassination near the end of his third year in office. Kennedy was the youngest person to assume the presidency by election. He was also the youngest president at the end of his tenure. Kennedy served at the height of the Cold War, and the majority of his work as president concerned relations with the Soviet Union and Cuba. A Democrat, he represented Massachusetts in both houses of the U.S. Congress prior to his presidency. Born into the prominent Kennedy family in Brookline, Massachusetts, Kennedy graduated from Harvard University in 1940 before joining the U.S. Naval Reserve the following year. During World War II, he commanded a series of PT boats in the Pacific theater. Kennedy's survival of the sinking of PT-109 and rescue of his fellow sailors made him a war hero for which he earned the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, but left him with serious injuries. After a brief stint in journalism, Kennedy represented a working-class Boston district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1947 to 1953. He was subsequently elected to the U.S. Senate and served as the junior senator for Massachusetts from 1953 to 1960. While in the Senate, Kennedy published his book, Profiles in Courage, which won a Pulitzer Prize. In the 1960 presidential election, he narrowly defeated Republican opponent Richard Nixon, who was the incumbent vice president. Kennedy's humor, charm, and youth in addition to his father's money and contacts were great assets in his campaign. Kennedy's campaign gained momentum after the first televised presidential debates in American history. He was the first Catholic elected president. Kennedy's administration included high tensions with communist states in the Cold War. As a result, he increased the number of American military advisers in South Vietnam. The Strategic Hamlet Program began in Vietnam during his presidency. In April 1961, he authorized an attempt to overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel Castro in the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion. In November 1961, he authorized the Operation Mongoose, also aimed at removing the communists from power in Cuba. He rejected Operation Northwoods in March 1962, but his administration continued to plan for an invasion of Cuba in the summer of 1962. The following October, U.S. spy planes discovered Soviet missile bases had been deployed in Cuba; the resulting period of tensions, termed the Cuban Missile Crisis, nearly resulted in the breakout of a global thermonuclear conflict. He also signed the first nuclear weapons treaty in October 1963. Kennedy presided over the establishment of the Peace Corps, Alliance for Progress with Latin America, and the continuation of the Apollo program with the goal of landing a man on the Moon before 1970. He also supported the civil rights movement but was only somewhat successful in passing his New Frontier domestic policies. On November 22, 1963, Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. His vice president, Lyndon B. Johnson, assumed the presidency upon Kennedy's death. Lee Harvey Oswald, a former U.S. Marine, was arrested for the assassination, but he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby two days later. The FBI and the Warren Commission both concluded Oswald had acted alone. After Kennedy's death, Congress enacted many of his proposals, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Revenue Act of 1964. Despite his truncated presidency, Kennedy ranks highly in polls of U.S. presidents with historians and the general public.

125,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Leonardo_DiCaprio,Leonardo DiCaprio,"Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio (/diˈkæprioʊ/; Italian: [diˈkaːprjo]; born November 11, 1974) is an American actor and film producer. Known for his work as a leading man in biopics and period films, he is the recipient of numerous accolades, including an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award, and three Golden Globe Awards. As of 2019, his films have grossed over $7.2 billion worldwide, and he has been placed eight times in annual rankings of the world's highest-paid actors. Born in Los Angeles, DiCaprio began his career in the late 1980s by appearing in television commercials. In the early 1990s, he had recurring roles in various television shows, such as the sitcom Parenthood, and had his first major film part as author Tobias Wolff in This Boy's Life (1993). At age 19, he received critical acclaim and his first Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for his performance as a developmentally disabled boy in What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993). He achieved international stardom with the star-crossed romances Romeo + Juliet (1996) and Titanic (1997). After the latter became the highest-grossing film at the time, he reduced his workload for a few years. In an attempt to shed his image of a romantic hero, DiCaprio sought roles in other genres, including crime drama in Catch Me If You Can (2002) and Gangs of New York (2002); the latter marked the first of his many successful collaborations with director Martin Scorsese. DiCaprio portrayed Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004) and received acclaim for his performances in the political thriller Blood Diamond (2006), the crime drama The Departed (2006), and the romantic drama Revolutionary Road (2008). In the following decade, DiCaprio starred in several high-profile directors' projects, including the action thriller Inception (2010), the western Django Unchained (2012), the romantic drama The Great Gatsby (2013), the biopic The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), the survival drama The Revenant (2015), for which he won an Academy Award and a BAFTA Award for Best Actor, and the comedy-drama Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), all of which were critical and commercial successes. DiCaprio is the founder of Appian Way Productions, a production company that has produced some of his films and the documentary series Greensburg (2008–2010), and the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting environmental awareness. He regularly supports charitable causes and has produced several documentaries on the environment. He currently serves as one of the United Nations Messengers of Peace. In 2005, he was named a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for his contributions to the arts, and in 2016, he appeared in Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world.","[['is', 'American'], ['Known as', 'leading man in biopics'], ['is recipient of', 'accolades'], ['is', 'recipient of accolades including Academy Award'], ['is', 'recipient of numerous

128,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Israel,Israel,"Israel (/ˈɪzri.əl, -reɪ-/; Hebrew: יִשְׂרָאֵל, Yīsrāʾēl; Arabic: إِسْرَائِيل, ʾIsrāʾīl), officially the State of Israel (מְדִינַת יִשְׂרָאֵל, Medīnat Yīsrāʾēl; دَوْلَة إِسْرَائِيل, Dawlat ʾIsrāʾīl), is a country in Western Asia. It is situated on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea, and shares borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan to the east, and Egypt to the southwest; it is also bordered by the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively. Tel Aviv is the economic and technological center of the country, while its seat of government is in its proclaimed capital of Jerusalem, although Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem is unrecognized internationally. The land held by present-day Israel witnessed some of the earliest human occupations outside Africa and was among the earliest known sites of agriculture. It was inhabited by the Canaanites during the Bronze Age. During the Iron Age, the kingdoms of Israel and Judah emerged, and later fell, respectively, to the Neo-Assyrian Empire (c. 720 BCE) and Neo-Babylonian Empire (586 BCE). During that period, much of the Hebrew Bible was written. The region was then ruled by the Achaemenid, Macedonian, Ptolemaic, and Seleucid empires. A successful Maccabean revolt led to the rise of an independent Hasmonean kingdom, but it was gradually incorporated into the Roman Republic. A series of large-scale Jewish revolts against Roman rule were unsuccessful, leading to wide-scale destruction, a high toll of life, and mass displacement. In the Middle Ages, the region was part of the Byzantine Empire, Rashidun Caliphate, Umayyad Caliphate, Abbasid Caliphate, and Fatimid Caliphate. With the First Crusade, Crusader states were established. The Ayyubids pushed back the crusaders before Muslim rule was fully restored by the Mamluk Sultanate, which ceded the territory to the Ottoman Empire at the outset of the early modern period. During the 19th century, the Zionist movement began promoting the creation of a Jewish homeland in Ottoman Syria. Following World War I, Britain was granted control of the region by the League of Nations mandate, in what became known as Mandatory Palestine. After World War II, the newly formed United Nations adopted the Partition Plan for Palestine in 1947, recommending the creation of independent Arab and Jewish states, and an internationalized Jerusalem. Partition was accepted by the Jewish leadership, but rejected by Palestinian Arab leaders and the Arab states. Following a civil war within Mandatory Palestine between Yishuv and Palestinian Arab forces, Israel declared independence at the termination of the British Mandate. A day later, several surrounding Arab countries intervened, leading to the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, which concluded with the 1949 Armistice Agreements that saw Israel in control of most of the former mandate territory, while the West Bank and Gaza were held by Jordan and Egypt respectively. Over 700,000 Palestinian Arabs, about half of the pre-war Arab population, were expelled from or fled the territory Israel would come to control. During and immediately after the war, around 260,000 Jews emigrated or fled from the Arab world to Israel. Israel has since fought wars with several Arab countries, and since the 1967 Six-Day War has occupied the Golan Heights and the Palestinian territories of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, though whether Gaza remains occupied following the Israeli disengagement is disputed. Israel has effectively annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, though these actions have been rejected as illegal by the international community, and established settlements within the occupied territories, which are also considered illegal under international law. While Israel has signed peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan, and has normalized relations with a number of other Arab countries, it remains formally at war with Syria and Lebanon, and efforts to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict have thus far stalled. In its Basic Laws, Israel defines itself as a Jewish and democratic state, and as the nation-state of the Jewish people. The country has a parliamentary system, proportional representation, and universal suffrage. The prime minister serves as head of government, while the Knesset is the unicameral legislature. Israel is a developed country and an OECD member, with a population of over nine million people as of 2021. It has the world's 29th-largest economy by nominal GDP, and ranks nineteenth in the Human Development Index.","[['is in', 'Western Asia'], ['is', 'country'], ['is situated on', 'shore'], ['is situated

129,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Turkey,Turkey,"Turkey (Turkish: Türkiye [ˈtyɾcije]), officially the Republic of Türkiye (Turkish: Türkiye Cumhuriyeti [ˈtyɾcije dʒumˈhuːɾijeti]), is a transcontinental country located mainly on the Anatolian Peninsula in Western Asia, with a small portion on the Balkan Peninsula in Southeast Europe. It shares borders with the Black Sea to the north; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran to the east; Iraq to the southeast; Syria and the Mediterranean Sea to the south; the Aegean Sea to the west; and Greece and Bulgaria to the northwest. Cyprus is located off the south coast. Turks form the vast majority of the nation's population and Kurds are the largest minority. Ankara is Turkey's capital, while Istanbul is its largest city and financial centre. One of the world's earliest permanently settled regions, present-day Turkey was home to important Neolithic sites like Göbekli Tepe, and was inhabited by ancient civilisations including the Hattians, Hittites, Anatolian peoples, Mycenaean Greeks, Persians and others. Following the conquests of Alexander the Great which started the Hellenistic period, most of the ancient regions in modern Turkey were culturally Hellenised, which continued during the Byzantine era. The Seljuk Turks began migrating in the 11th century, and the Sultanate of Rum ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243, when it disintegrated into small Turkish principalities. Beginning in the late 13th century, the Ottomans united the principalities and conquered the Balkans, and the Turkification of Anatolia increased during the Ottoman period. After Mehmed II conquered Constantinople (Istanbul) in 1453, Ottoman expansion continued under Selim I. During the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman Empire became a global power. From the late 18th century onwards, the empire's power declined with a gradual loss of territories. Mahmud II started a period of modernisation in the early 19th century. The Young Turk Revolution of 1908 restricted the authority of the Sultan and restored the Ottoman Parliament after a 30-year suspension, ushering the empire into a multi-party period. The 1913 coup d'état put the country under the control of the Three Pashas, who facilitated the Empire's entry into World War I as part of the Central Powers in 1914. During the war, the Ottoman government committed genocides against its Armenian, Greek and Assyrian subjects. After its defeat in the war, the Ottoman Empire was partitioned. The Turkish War of Independence against the occupying Allied Powers resulted in the abolition of the Sultanate on 1 November 1922, the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne (which superseded the Treaty of Sèvres) on 24 July 1923 and the proclamation of the Republic on 29 October 1923. With the reforms initiated by the country's first president, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, Turkey became a secular, unitary and parliamentary republic. Turkey played a prominent role in the Korean War and joined NATO in 1952. The country endured several military coups in the latter half of the 20th century. The economy was liberalised in the 1980s, leading to stronger economic growth and political stability. The parliamentary republic was replaced with a presidential system by referendum in 2017. Turkey is a regional power and a newly industrialized country, with a geopolitically strategic location. Its economy, which is classified among the emerging and growth-leading economies, is the twentieth-largest in the world by nominal GDP, and the eleventh-largest by PPP. In addition to being an early member of NATO, Turkey is a charter member of the United Nations, the IMF, and the World Bank, and a founding member of the OECD, OSCE, BSEC, OIC, OTS and G20. After becoming one of the early members of the Council of Europe in 1950, Turkey became an associate member of the EEC in 1963, joined the EU Customs Union in 1995, and started accession negotiations with the European Union in 2005. Turkey has a rich cultural legacy shaped by centuries of history and the influence of the various peoples that have inhabited its territory over several millennia; it is home to 19 UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is among the most visited countries in the world.","[['is', 'country'], ['is', 'transcontinental country located on Anatolian Peninsula in Western Asia'], ['is', 'country located mainly on Anatolian Peninsula in Western Asia'], ['is', 'transcontinental country located'], ['is', 'transcontinental country located mainly on Anatolian Peninsula in Western Asia'], ['is', 'country located mainly on Anatolian Peninsula'], ['is', 'country located on Anatolian Peninsula in Western Asia'], ['is', 'country located on Anatolian Peninsula'], ['is', 'transcontinental country'], ['is', 'country located'], ['is', 'transcontinental located'], ['is', 'transcontinental country located on Anatolian Peninsula'], ['Republic of', 'Türkiye'], ['is', 'transcontinental country located mainly on Anatolian Peninsula'], ['shares borders with', 'Black Sea'], ['shares', 'borders'], ['shares borders to', 'north'], ['has', 'capital'], ['disintegrated into', 'small principalities'], ['disintegrated into', 'Turkish principalities'], ['disintegrated into', 'principalities'], ['disintegrated into', 'small Turkish principalities'], ['played', 'role'], ['played', 'prominent role'], ['joined', 'NATO'], ['played', 'role in Korean War'], ['played', 'prominent role in Korean War'], ['joined NATO in', '1952'], ['is regional power with', 'geopolitically strategic location'], ['is', 'power'], ['is power with', 'geopolitically strategic location'], ['is power with', 'strategic location'], ['is', 'regional'], ['is', 'regional power'], ['is power with', 'location'], ['is regional power with', 'location'], ['is regional power with', 'strategic location'], ['is', 'charter member'], ['is', 'charter member of United Nations'], ['became', 'member of EEC'], ['associate member of', 'EEC'], ['became', 'associate member'], ['became', 'member'], ['became', 'associate member of EEC'], ['became in', '1963'], ['member of', 'EEC'], ['is', 'home to 19 UNESCO World Heritage Sites'], ['influence of', 'peoples'], ['influence of', 'various peoples']]","[['isIn', 'transcontinental_country'], ['locatedIn', 'Anatolian_Peninsula'], ['isIn', 'Western_Asia'], ['isIn', 'country'], ['type', 'transcontinental_country'], ['dependsOn', 'country'], ['isOn', 'Anatolian_Peninsula'], ['type', 'transcontinental'], ['isOn', 'transcontinental_country'], ['republicOf', 'Türkiye'], ['bordersWith', 'Black_Sea'], ['shares', 'borders'], ['shares', 'north'], ['has', 'capital'], ['splitInto', 'small_principalities'], ['splitInto', 'Turkish_principalities'], ['splitInto', 'principalities'], ['splitInto', 'small_Turkish_principalities'], ['played', 'role'], ['played', 'prominent_role'], ['joined', 'NATO'], ['playedIn', 'role'], ['participatedIn', 'Korean_War'], ['participatedIn', 'prominent_role'], ['isWith', 'geopolitically_strategic_location'], ['isWith', 'strategic_location'], ['type', 'regional_power'], ['isWith', 'location'], ['type', 'charter_member'], ['isOf', 'charter_member'], ['memberOf', 'United_Nations'], ['becameOf', 'member'], ['memberOf', 'EEC'], ['became', 'associate_member'], ['became', 'member'], ['becameOf', 'associate_member'], ['homeTo', '19_UNESCO_World_Heritage_Sites'], ['influenceOf', 'peoples'], ['influenceOf', 'various_peoples']]"
130,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Elton_John,Elton John,"Sir Elton Hercules John CH CBE (born Reginald Kenneth Dwight; 25 March 1947) is a British singer, pianist and composer. Commonly nicknamed the ""Rocket Man"" after his 1972 hit single of the same name, John has led a commercially successful career as a solo artist since the 1970s, having released 31 albums since 1969. Collaborating with lyricist Bernie Taupin since 1967, John is acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his work during the 1970s, and his lasting impact on the music industry. John's music and showmanship have had a significant impact on popular music. His songwriting partnership with Taupin is one of the most successful in history. John was raised in the Pinner suburb of London and learned to play piano at an early age, forming the blues band Bluesology in 1962. After leaving Bluesology in 1967 to embark on a solo career, John met Taupin after they both answered an advert for songwriters. For two years, they wrote songs for other artists, and John worked as a session musician for artists. John released his debut album Empty Sky in 1969, and a year later formed the Elton John Band and released his first hit single, ""Your Song"". John's critical success was at its peak in the 1970s, when he released a streak of chart-topping albums in the US and UK, which began with Honky Château (1972) and culminated with Blue Moves (1976). John continued his success in the 1980s and 1990s, having several hit singles and albums in both decades, and has continued to record new music since then. He has also had success in musical films and theatre, composing music for The Lion King, Aida and Billy Elliot the Musical. In 2018, John began his ongoing farewell tour Farewell Yellow Brick Road, which will conclude in 2023. His life and music career was dramatised in the 2019 biopic Rocketman. Outside of music, John is an HIV/AIDS charity fundraiser and has been involved in the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s. He established the Elton John AIDS Foundation in 1992, which has raised over £300 million since its inception, and a year later he began hosting his annual Foundation Academy Awards Party, which has since become one of the biggest high-profile Oscar parties in the Hollywood film industry. John was the chairman and director of Watford F.C, from 1976 to 1987, and again from 1997 to 2002, and is an honorary life president of the club. From the late 1970s to the late 1980s, John developed a severe addiction problem to drugs and alcohol, but has been sober since 1990. He entered into a civil partnership with Canadian filmmaker David Furnish in 2005; they married after same-sex marriage became legal in England and Wales in 2014. John has sold over 300 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time. He has more than fifty Top 40 hits in the UK Singles Chart and US Billboard Hot 100, including nine number ones in the UK and US, as well as seven consecutive number-one albums in the US. His tribute single ""Candle in the Wind 1997"", a rewritten version of his 1974 single in dedication to Princess Diana, sold over 33 million copies worldwide and is the best-selling chart single of all time. In 2021, John became the first solo artist with UK Top 10 singles across six decades. John has received numerous awards, including five Grammy Awards, five Brit Awards; including for Outstanding Contribution to Music; two Academy Awards, two Golden Globes, a Tony Award, a Laurence Olivier Award, a Disney Legend Award, and the Kennedy Center Honor. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1992 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, and is a fellow of The Ivors Academy. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for services to music and charitable services in 1998, and was appointed a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour by King Charles III (then Prince of Wales) in 2020.","[['is', 'British'], ['has led career as', 'solo artist'], ['has led career since', '1970s'], ['has led', 'successful career'], ['has led', 'commercially successful career'],

131,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/George_Washington,George Washington,"George Washington (February 22, 1732 – December 14, 1799) was an American military officer, statesman, and Founding Father who served as the first president of the United States from 1789 to 1797. Appointed by the Continental Congress as commander of the Continental Army, Washington led the Patriot forces to victory in the American Revolutionary War and served as the president of the Constitutional Convention of 1787, which created the Constitution of the United States and the American federal government. Washington has been called the ""Father of his Country"" for his manifold leadership in the formative days of the country. Washington's first public office was serving as the official surveyor of Culpeper County, Virginia, from 1749 to 1750. Subsequently, he received his first military training (as well as a command with the Virginia Regiment) during the French and Indian War. He was later elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses and was named a delegate to the Continental Congress where he was appointed Commanding General of the Continental Army. With this title, he commanded American forces (allied with France) in the defeat and surrender of the British at the Siege of Yorktown during the American Revolutionary War. He resigned his commission after the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1783. Washington played an indispensable role in adopting and ratifying the Constitution of the United States, which was a replacement of the original constitution, the Articles of Confederation. He was then twice elected president by the Electoral College unanimously. As president, he implemented a strong, well-financed national government while remaining impartial in a fierce rivalry between cabinet members Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton. During the French Revolution, he proclaimed a policy of neutrality while sanctioning the Jay Treaty. He set enduring precedents for the office of president, including the title ""Mr. President"", and swearing the Oath of Office on the Bible. His Farewell Address is widely regarded as a pre-eminent statement on republicanism. Washington was a slave owner who had a complicated relationship with slavery. During his lifetime he controlled a cumulative total of over 577 slaves, who were forced to work on his farms and wherever he lived, including the President's House in Philadelphia. As president, he signed laws passed by Congress that both protected and curtailed slavery. His will said that one of his slaves, William Lee, should be freed upon his death and that the other 123 slaves must work for his wife and be freed on her death. She freed them during her lifetime to remove the incentive for hastening her death. He endeavored to assimilate Native Americans into the Anglo-American culture. However, he waged military campaigns against hostile Native American nations during the Revolutionary War and the Northwest Indian War. He was a member of the Anglican Church and the Freemasons, and he urged broad religious freedom in his roles as general and president. Upon his death, he was eulogized by Henry ""Light-Horse Harry"" Lee as ""first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen"". Washington has been memorialized by monuments, a federal holiday, various media depictions, geographical locations, including the national capital, the State of Washington, stamps, and currency, and many scholars and ordinary Americans alike rank him among the greatest U.S. presidents. In 1976, Washington was posthumously promoted to the rank of General of the Armies of the United States, the highest rank in the United States Army.","[['was', 'American'], ['was', 'military'],

Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x, Windows Mobile, and Windows Phone. The first version of Windows was released on November 20, 1985, as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Windows is the most popular desktop operating system in the world, with 75% market share as of April 2022, according to StatCounter. However, Windows is not the most used operating system when including both mobile and desktop OSes, due to Android's massive growth.

133,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Taylor_Swift,Taylor Swift,"Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her discography spans multiple genres, and her narrative songwriting—often inspired by her personal life—has received critical praise. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville at age 14 to become a country artist. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005. Her 2006 self-titled debut album made her the first female country singer to write or co-write a US platinum-certified album entirely. Swift's next albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010), explored country pop. The former's ""Love Story"" and ""You Belong with Me"" were the first country songs to top the US pop and all-genre airplay charts, respectively. She experimented with rock and electronic styles on Red (2012), which featured her first U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"", and eschewed her country image in her synth-pop album, 1989 (2014), supported by chart-topping songs ""Shake It Off"", ""Blank Space"", and ""Bad Blood"". Media scrutiny inspired the urban-flavored Reputation (2017) and its U.S. number-one single ""Look What You Made Me Do"". Exiting Big Machine, Swift signed with Republic Records in 2018 and released her seventh studio album, Lover (2019), followed by the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She ventured into indie folk and alternative rock in her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, whose singles ""Cardigan"" and ""Willow"" topped the Hot 100. Swift began re-recording her first six albums after a dispute over their masters, re-releasing two in 2021—Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version). The latter's ""All Too Well (10 Minute Version)"" became the longest song to top the Hot 100. Her tenth album Midnights (2022) and its lead single ""Anti-Hero"" broke numerous streaming records. Swift has self-directed music videos and films, such as All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), and had supporting roles in others. Having sold over 200 million records globally, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians of all time. She is the only act to have five albums open with over one million copies sold in the US. Among her accolades are 11 Grammy Awards, including three Album of the Year wins; an Emmy Award; 40 American Music Awards; 29 Billboard Music Awards; and 84 Guinness World Records. Swift has been featured in rankings such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, the Time 100 and Forbes Celebrity 100. Honored with titles such as Artist of the Decade and Woman of the Decade, Swift is an advocate for artists' rights and women's empowerment. Her music is credited with influencing a generation of singer-songwriters.","[['is', 'American'], ['moved', 'to become'], ['moved in', 'Pennsylvania'], ['moved to', 'Nashville'], ['moved', 'become'], ['moved in', 'West Reading'], ['moved', '14'], ['moved at', 'age'], ['signed', 'deal'], ['signed', 'songwriting deal'], ['signed deal with', 'Sony ATV Music Publishing'], ['signed deal in', '2004'], ['has', 'next albums'], [""'s albums is"", 'Fearless 2008'], [""'s albums is"", 'explored country pop'], ['album', '1989'], ['experimented', 'supported'], ['experimented', 'with supported'], ['released', 'Lover'], ['album', 'Lover'], ['released', 'her seventh studio album'], ['signed with', 'Republic Records'], ['signed in', '2018'], ['released', 'her studio album'], ['ventured into', 'folk'], ['ventured in', 'her 2020 albums Folklore'], ['ventured into', 'indie folk'], ['has', 'Version'], ['has', 'Version'], ['sold', 'over 200 million records'], ['sold globally', 'over 200 million records'], ['is', 'act'], ['have', 'five albums open'], ['is', 'only act'], ['have', 'five albums'], ['has', 'has featured'], ['has', 'has featured in rankings'], ['is advocate for', ""artists ' rights""], ['is', 'advocate']]","[['movedIn', 'Pennsylvania'], ['movedTo', 'Nashville'], ['movedAt', 'age'], ['signedSigned', 'deal'], ['signed', 'songwriting_deal'], ['signedWith', 'Sony_ATV_Music_Publishing'], ['nowHas', 'next_albums'], ['with', 'Fearless'], ['type', 'country'], ['released', 'Lover'], ['remixAlbum', 'Lover'], ['released', 'seventh_studio_album'], ['signedWith', 'Republic_Records'], ['released', 'studio_album'], ['venturedInto', 'folk'], ['venturedIn', '2020_albums'], ['venturedInto', 'indie'], ['has', 'Version'], ['sold', 'over_200_million_records'], ['haveOpen', 'five_albums'], ['have', 'five_albums'], ['featuredIn', 'rankings'], ['advocatesFor', ""artists_'_rights""]]"
134,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Nelson_Mandela,Nelson Mandela,"Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (/mænˈdɛlə/; Xhosa: [xolíɬaɬa mandɛ̂ːla]; 18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013) was a South African anti-apartheid activist who served as the first president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he served as the president of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997. A Xhosa, Mandela was born into the Thembu royal family in Mvezo, Union of South Africa. He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in Johannesburg. There he became involved in anti-colonial and African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its Youth League in 1944. After the National Party's white-only government established apartheid, a system of racial segregation that privileged whites, Mandela and the ANC committed themselves to its overthrow. He was appointed president of the ANC's Transvaal branch, rising to prominence for his involvement in the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People. He was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial. Influenced by Marxism, he secretly joined the banned South African Communist Party (SACP). Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the SACP he co-founded the militant uMkhonto we Sizwe in 1961 and led a sabotage campaign against the government. He was arrested and imprisoned in 1962, and, following the Rivonia Trial, was sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the state. Mandela served 27 years in prison, split between Robben Island, Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison. Amid growing domestic and international pressure and fears of racial civil war, President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk led efforts to negotiate an end to apartheid, which resulted in the 1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became president. Leading a broad coalition government which promulgated a new constitution, Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses. Economically, his administration retained its predecessor's liberal framework despite his own socialist beliefs, also introducing measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty and expand healthcare services. Internationally, Mandela acted as mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as secretary-general of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999. He declined a second presidential term and was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki. Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela Foundation. Mandela was a controversial figure for much of his life. Although critics on the right denounced him as a communist terrorist and those on the far left deemed him too eager to negotiate and reconcile with apartheid's supporters, he gained international acclaim for his activism. Globally regarded as an icon of democracy and social justice, he received more than 250 honours, including the Nobel Peace Prize. He is held in deep respect within South Africa, where he is often referred to by his Thembu clan name, Madiba, and described as the ""Father of the Nation"".","[['was', 'anti-apartheid'], ['was',

After the final Harry Potter film, she took on a supporting role in My Week with Marilyn (2011), before starring as Sam, a flirtatious, free-spirited student in The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012) to critical success. Further acclaim came from portraying Alexis Neiers in Sofia Coppola's The Bling Ring (2013) and the titular character's adoptive daughter in Darren Aronofsky's biblical epic Noah. That same year, Watson was honoured by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, winning British Artist of the Year.

Widely referred to as the ""Queen of Rock 'n' Roll"", she rose to prominence as the lead singer of the Ike and Tina Turner Revue before launching a successful career as a solo performer. Turner began her career with Ike Turner's Kings of Rhythm in 1957. Under the name Little Ann, she appeared on her first record, ""Boxtop"", in 1958. In 1960, she debuted as Tina Turner with the hit duet single ""A Fool in Love"". The duo Ike & Tina Turner became ""one of the most formidable live acts in history"". They released hits such as ""It's Gonna Work Out Fine"", ""River Deep – Mountain High"", ""Proud Mary"", and ""Nutbush City Limits"" before disbanding in 1976. In the 1980s, Turner launched ""one of the greatest comebacks in music history"". Her 1984 multi-platinum album Private Dancer contained the hit song ""What's Love Got to Do with It"", which won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and became her first and only number one song on the Billboard Hot 100. At age 44, she was the oldest female solo artist to top the Hot 100. Her chart success continued with ""Better Be Good to Me"", ""Private Dancer"", ""We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)"", ""Typical Male"", ""The Best"", ""I Don't Wanna Fight"", and ""GoldenEye"". During her Break Every Rule World Tour in 1988, she set a then-Guinness World Record for the largest paying audience (180,000) for a solo performer. Turner also acted in the films Tommy (1975), Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985), and Last Action Hero (1993). In 1993, What's Love Got to Do with It, a biopic adapted from her autobiography I, Tina: My Life Story, was released. In 2009, Turner retired after completing her Tina!: 50th Anniversary Tour, which is the 15th highest-grossing tour of the 2000s. In 2018, she became the subject of the jukebox musical Tina. Having sold over 100 million records worldwide, Turner is one of the best-selling recording artists of all time. She has received 12 Grammy Awards, which include eight competitive awards, three Grammy Hall of Fame awards, and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. She is the first black artist and first female to be on the cover of Rolling Stone. Rolling Stone ranked her among the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time. Turner has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the St. Louis Walk of Fame. She is a two-time inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, with Ike Turner in 1991 and as a solo artist in 2021. She is also a 2005 recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors and Women of the Year award.","[['is', 'Swiss'], ['is', 'retired'], ['is', 'born'], ['referred to', 'to Queen'], ['rose as', 'lead singer'],

138,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Margaret_Thatcher,Margaret Thatcher,"Margaret Hilda Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher, LG, OM, DStJ, PC, FRS, HonFRSC (née Roberts; 13 October 1925 – 8 April 2013), was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990 and Leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990. She was the first female British prime minister and the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century. As prime minister, she implemented economic policies that became known as Thatcherism. A Soviet journalist dubbed her the ""Iron Lady"", a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style. Thatcher studied chemistry at Somerville College, Oxford, and worked briefly as a research chemist, before becoming a barrister. She was elected Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959. Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his 1970–1974 government. In 1975, she defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition, the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom. On becoming prime minister after winning the 1979 general election, Thatcher introduced a series of economic policies intended to reverse high inflation and Britain's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an oncoming recession. Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation (particularly of the financial sector), the privatisation of state-owned companies, and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. Her popularity in her first years in office waned amid recession and rising unemployment. Victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support, resulting in her landslide re-election in 1983. She survived an assassination attempt by the Provisional IRA in the 1984 Brighton hotel bombing and achieved a political victory against the National Union of Mineworkers in the 1984–85 miners' strike. Thatcher was re-elected for a third term with another landslide in 1987, but her subsequent support for the Community Charge (""poll tax"") was widely unpopular, and her increasingly Eurosceptic views on the European Community were not shared by others in her cabinet. She resigned as prime minister and party leader in 1990, after a challenge was launched to her leadership, and was succeeded by John Major, the Chancellor of the Exchequer. After retiring from the Commons in 1992, she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher (of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire) which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords. In 2013, she died of a stroke at the Ritz Hotel, London, at the age of 87. A polarising figure in British politics, Thatcher is nonetheless viewed favourably in historical rankings and public opinion of British prime ministers. Her tenure constituted a realignment towards neoliberal policies in Britain, with the complicated legacy attributed to Thatcherism debated into the 21st century.","[['longest serving British minister

139,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Napoleon,Napoleon,"Napoleon Bonaparte (born Napoleone Buonaparte; 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821), later known by his regnal name Napoleon I, was a French military commander and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led successful campaigns during the Revolutionary Wars. He was the de facto leader of the French Republic as First Consul from 1799 to 1804, then Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814 and again in 1815. Napoleon's political and cultural legacy endures to this day, as a highly celebrated and controversial leader. He initiated many liberal reforms that have persisted in society, and is considered one of the greatest military commanders in history, but between three and six million civilians and soldiers perished in what became known as the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon was born on the island of Corsica, not long after its annexation by France, to a native family descending from minor Italian nobility. He supported the French Revolution in 1789 while serving in the French army, and tried to spread its ideals to his native Corsica. He rose rapidly in the Army after he saved the governing French Directory by firing on royalist insurgents. In 1796, he began a military campaign against the Austrians and their Italian allies, scoring decisive victories and becoming a national hero. Two years later, he led a military expedition to Egypt that served as a springboard to political power. He engineered a coup in November 1799 and became First Consul of the Republic. Differences with the United Kingdom meant France faced the War of the Third Coalition by 1805. Napoleon shattered this coalition with victories in the Ulm campaign, and at the Battle of Austerlitz, which led to the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1806, the Fourth Coalition took up arms against him. Napoleon defeated Prussia at the battles of Jena and Auerstedt, marched the Grande Armée into Eastern Europe, and defeated the Russians in June 1807 at Friedland, forcing the defeated nations of the Fourth Coalition to accept the Treaties of Tilsit. Two years later, the Austrians challenged the French again during the War of the Fifth Coalition, but Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the Battle of Wagram. Hoping to extend the Continental System, his embargo against Britain, Napoleon invaded the Iberian Peninsula and declared his brother Joseph the King of Spain in 1808. The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted in the Peninsular War, culminating in defeat for Napoleon's marshals. Napoleon launched an invasion of Russia in the summer of 1812. The resulting campaign witnessed the catastrophic retreat of Napoleon's Grande Armée. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in a Sixth Coalition against France, resulting in a large coalition army defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig. The coalition invaded France and captured Paris, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April 1814. He was exiled to the island of Elba, between Corsica and Italy. In France, the Bourbons were restored to power. Napoleon escaped in February 1815 and took control of France. The Allies responded by forming a Seventh Coalition, which defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. The British exiled him to the remote island of Saint Helena in the Atlantic, where he died in 1821 at the age of 51. Napoleon had an extensive impact on the modern world, bringing liberal reforms to the lands he conquered, especially the regions of the Low Countries, Switzerland and parts of modern Italy and Germany. He implemented many liberal policies in France and Western Europe.","[['led campaigns during', 'Revolutionary Wars'], ['rose during', 'French Revolution'], ['led', 'campaigns'], ['led', 'successful

140,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Shaquille_O'Neal,Shaquille O'Neal,"Shaquille Rashaun O'Neal (/ʃəˈkiːl/ shə-KEEL; born March 6, 1972), known commonly as ""Shaq"" (/ʃæk/ SHAK), is an American former professional basketball player who is a sports analyst on the television program Inside the NBA. O'Neal is regarded as one of the greatest basketball players and centers of all time. He is a 7-foot-1-inch (2.16 m) and 325-pound (147 kg) center who played for six teams over his 19-year career in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and is a four-time NBA champion. After playing college basketball for the LSU Tigers, O'Neal was drafted by the Orlando Magic with the first overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft. He quickly became one of the best centers in the league, winning Rookie of the Year in 1992–93 and leading his team to the 1995 NBA Finals. After four years with the Magic, O'Neal signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Lakers. They won three consecutive championships in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Amid tension between O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat in 2004, and his fourth NBA championship followed in 2006. Midway through the 2007–2008 season he was traded to the Phoenix Suns. After a season-and-a-half with the Suns, O'Neal was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2009–10 season. O'Neal played for the Boston Celtics in the 2010–11 season before retiring. O'Neal's individual accolades include the 1999–2000 Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award; the 1992–93 NBA Rookie of the Year award; 15 All-Star Game selections, three All-Star Game MVP awards; three Finals MVP awards; two scoring titles; 14 All-NBA team selections, and three NBA All-Defensive Team selections. He is one of only three players to win NBA MVP, All-Star Game MVP and Finals MVP awards in the same year (2000); the other players are Willis Reed in 1970 and Michael Jordan in 1996 and 1998. He ranks 8th all-time in points scored, 6th in field goals, 15th in rebounds, and 8th in blocks. O'Neal was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all-time by being named to the NBA 50th Anniversary Team in 1996. Due to his ability to dunk the basketball and score from close range, O'Neal also ranks third all-time in field goal percentage (58.2%). O'Neal was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016. He was elected to the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2017. In October 2021, O'Neal was again honored as one of the league's greatest players of all-time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. In addition to his basketball career, O'Neal has released four rap albums, with his first, Shaq Diesel, going platinum. O'Neal is also an electronic music producer, and touring DJ, known as DIESEL. He has appeared in numerous films and has starred in his own reality shows, Shaq's Big Challenge and Shaq Vs. He hosts The Big Podcast with Shaq. He was a minority owner of the Sacramento Kings from 2013 to 2022 and is the general manager of Kings Guard Gaming of the NBA 2K League.","[['is', 'American former basketball player'], ['is',

141,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Franklin_D._Roosevelt,Franklin D. Roosevelt,"Franklin Delano Roosevelt (/ˈdɛlənoʊ/; /ˈroʊzəˌvɛlt, -vəlt/ ROH-zə-velt, -⁠vəlt; January 30, 1882 – April 12, 1945), often referred to by his initials FDR, was an American politician and attorney who served as the 32nd president of the United States from 1933 until his death in 1945. As the leader of the Democratic Party, he won a record four presidential elections and became a central figure in world events during the first half of the 20th century. Roosevelt directed the federal government during most of the Great Depression, implementing his New Deal domestic agenda in response to the worst economic crisis in U.S. history. He built the New Deal Coalition, which defined modern liberalism in the United States throughout the middle third of the 20th century. His third and fourth terms were dominated by World War II, which ended in victory shortly after he died in office. Born into the prominent Roosevelt family in Hyde Park, New York, he graduated from both Groton School and Harvard College, and attended Columbia Law School, which he left after passing the bar exam to practice law in New York City. In 1905, he married his fifth cousin once removed, Eleanor Roosevelt. They had six children, of whom five survived into adulthood. He won election to the New York State Senate in 1910, and then served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under President Woodrow Wilson during World War I. Roosevelt was James M. Cox's running mate on the Democratic Party's 1920 national ticket, but Cox was defeated by Republican Warren G. Harding. In 1921, Roosevelt contracted a paralytic illness diagnosed as polio and his legs became permanently paralyzed. While attempting to recover from his condition, Roosevelt founded a polio rehabilitation center in Warm Springs, Georgia. Although unable to walk unaided, Roosevelt returned to public office after his election as governor of New York in 1928. He served as governor from 1929 to 1933, promoting programs to combat the economic crisis besetting the United States. In the 1932 presidential election, Roosevelt defeated Republican incumbent Herbert Hoover and began his presidency in the midst of the Great Depression. During the first 100 days of the 73rd U.S. Congress, he spearheaded unprecedented federal legislative productivity. Roosevelt called for the creation of programs designed to produce relief, recovery, and reform. Within his first year, he began implementing these policies through a series of executive orders and federal legislation collectively called the New Deal. Many New Deal programs provided relief to the unemployed such as the National Recovery Administration. Several New Deal programs and federal laws such as the Agricultural Adjustment Act provided relief to farmers. Roosevelt also instituted major regulatory reforms related to finance, communications, and labor. In addition to the economy, Roosevelt sought to find a compromise on Prohibition with the urban and rural wings of the Democratic Party. After campaigning on a platform to repeal it, Roosevelt implemented the Beer Permit Act of 1933 and enforced the 21st amendment. Tax revenue collected from alcohol sales would go to public works as part of the New Deal. Roosevelt frequently used radio to speak directly to the American people, giving 30 ""fireside chat"" radio addresses during his presidency and became the first American president to be televised. The economy improved rapidly during Roosevelt's first term and he won re-election in 1936, in one of the most lopsided victories in American history. Despite the popularity of the New Deal among supporters of Roosevelt, from 1936 onwards, New Deal legislation was frequently struck down by the US Supreme Court, which maintained a conservative bent. The dispute between Roosevelt and the Court resulted in Roosevelt lobbying for the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937 (or ""court packing plan""), which would have expanded the size of the Supreme Court. The bill was blocked by the newly formed bipartisan Conservative Coalition, which also sought to prevent further New Deal legislation. During the recession of 1937–1938, Roosevelt launched a rhetorical campaign against big business and monopoly power in the United States. Other major 1930s legislation and agencies implemented under Roosevelt include the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Labor Relations Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Social Security, and the Fair Labor Standards Act. Roosevelt was re-elected in 1940 for his third term, making him the only U.S. president to serve for more than two terms. By 1939 another World War was on the horizon which prompted the United States to respond by passing a series of laws affirming neutrality and rejecting intervention. Despite this, President Roosevelt gave strong diplomatic and financial support to China, the United Kingdom, and eventually the Soviet Union. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, an event he called ""a date which will live in infamy"", Roosevelt obtained a congressional declaration of war against Japan. On December 11 Japan's allies, Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy declared war on the United States. In response, the US formally joined the Allies and entered the European theater of war. Assisted by his top aide Harry Hopkins and with very strong national support, he worked closely with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Soviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin, and Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in leading the Allied Powers against the Axis Powers. Roosevelt supervised the mobilization of the U.S. economy to support the war effort and implemented a Europe first strategy, initiating the Lend-Lease program and making the defeat of Germany first a priority over that of Japan. Domestically, his administration co-ordinated massive wartime efforts such as the construction of the Pentagon and the Manhattan Project, which saw the creation of the atomic bomb. His foreign policy mirrored Wilsonian ideals which prompted Roosevelt to make his highest postwar priority being the establishment of the United Nations. Roosevelt expected the United Nations to replace the now defunct League of Nations and to be led by Washington, Moscow, London, and Nanjing. These states collectively called the Big Four would work to resolve all major world problems. It was under his wartime leadership that the United States became a superpower on the world stage. Roosevelt won re-election in the 1944 presidential election on his post-war recovery platform. His physical health began declining during the later war years, and less than three months into his fourth term, Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945. Vice President Harry S. Truman assumed office as president and oversaw the acceptance of surrender by the Axis powers. Since his death, several of Roosevelt's actions have come under substantial criticism, such as the relocation and internment of Japanese Americans in concentration camps. Nevertheless, he is consistently ranked by scholars, political scientists and historians as one of the greatest presidents in American history.","[['was', 'American'], ['became during', 'first half of

142,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Afghanistan,Afghanistan,"Afghanistan, officially the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, is a landlocked country located at the crossroads of Central Asia and South Asia. Referred to as the Heart of Asia, it is bordered by Pakistan to the east and south, Iran to the west, Turkmenistan to the northwest, Uzbekistan to the north, Tajikistan to the northeast, and China to the northeast and east. Occupying 652,864 square kilometers (252,072 sq mi) of land, the country is predominantly mountainous with plains in the north and the southwest, which are separated by the Hindu Kush mountain range. As of 2021, its population is 40.2 million (officially estimated to be 32.9 million), composed mostly of ethnic Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, and Uzbeks. Kabul is the country's largest city and serves as its capital. Human habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the Middle Paleolithic era, and the country's strategic location along the historic Silk Road has led it to being described, picturesquely, as the ‘roundabout of the ancient world’. Popularly referred to as the graveyard of empires, the land has historically been home to various peoples and has witnessed numerous military campaigns, including those by the Persians, Alexander the Great, the Maurya Empire, Arab Muslims, the Mongols, the British, the Soviet Union, and most recently by an American-led coalition. Afghanistan also served as the source from which the Greco-Bactrians and the Mughals, among others, rose to form major empires. The various conquests and periods in both the Iranian and Indian cultural spheres made the area a center for Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and later Islam throughout history. The modern state of Afghanistan began with the Durrani dynasty in the 18th century, with the Durrani Afghan Empire being formed by Ahmad Shah Durrani. The Durrani Empire led conquests in which, at its peak, encompassed land that spanned from eastern Iran to northern India. Following its decline and the death of Ahmad Shah Durrani, and Timur Shah, it was divided into multiple smaller independent kingdoms, including but not limited to: Herat, Kandahar and Kabul. Afghanistan would be reunited in the 19th century after wars of unification led by Dost Mohammad Khan, where he conquered the independent principalities in Afghanistan. Dost Mohammad died in 1863, weeks after his last campaign to unite Afghanistan, and as a result, threw Afghanistan back into civil war with his successors. During this time, Afghanistan became a buffer state in the Great Game between the British Empire (in British-ruled India) and the Russian Empire. From India, the British attempted to subjugate Afghanistan but were repelled in the First Anglo-Afghan War. However, the Second Anglo-Afghan War saw a British victory and the successful establishment of British political influence over Afghanistan. Following the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919, Afghanistan became free of foreign dominance, and eventually emerged as the independent Kingdom of Afghanistan in June 1926 under Amanullah Khan. This monarchy lasted almost 50 years, until Zahir Shah was overthrown in 1973, following which the Republic of Afghanistan was established. Since the late 1970s, Afghanistan's history has been dominated by extensive warfare, including coups, invasions, insurgencies, and civil wars which would end twice with the victory of the Islamic fundamentalist Taliban. In 1979 the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. Mujahideen fought against them in the Soviet–Afghan War and continued fighting amongst themselves following Soviet withdrawal in 1989. The Taliban controlled most of the country by 1996, but their Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan received little international recognition before its overthrow in the 2001 United States invasion of Afghanistan. The Taliban returned to power in 2021 following Kabul's capture by the Taliban and the concurrent overthrow of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, ending the 2001–2021 war. Although initially claiming to form an inclusive government for the country, the Taliban in September 2021 re-established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan with an interim government made up entirely of Taliban members; the regime currently remains internationally unrecognized. Afghanistan is prominently rich in natural resources, including lithium, iron, zinc, and copper, amongst many others. It is also the world's largest producer of opium, second largest producer of cannabis, and third largest of both saffron and cashmere. The country is a member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and a founding member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. Due to the effects of war in recent decades, the country has dealt with high levels of terrorism, poverty, and child malnutrition. Afghanistan's economy is the world's 96th-largest, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $72.9 billion by purchasing power parity; the country fares much worse in terms of per-capita GDP (PPP), ranking 169th out of 186 countries as of 2018.","[['located at', 'crossroads Central Asia'], ['is', 'landlocked located'], ['is', 'landlocked country located'], ['is', 'country'], ['is', 'country

After appearing on the children's television series Barney & Friends (2002–2004), Lovato rose to prominence for playing Mitchie Torres in the musical television film Camp Rock (2008) and its sequel Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam (2010). The former film's soundtrack contained ""This Is Me"", Lovato's debut single and duet with Joe Jonas, which peaked at number nine on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. After signing with Hollywood Records, Lovato released her pop rock debut album, Don't Forget (2008), which debuted at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200. Its follow-up, Here We Go Again (2009), debuted at number one in the U.S., while its title track reached number 15 on the Hot 100. Her third studio album, Unbroken (2011), experimented with pop and R&B and spawned the U.S. platinum-certified single ""Skyscraper"". She released her eponymous fourth album in 2013, which debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, and contained the top-ten international song ""Heart Attack"". Lovato's fifth and sixth albums, Confident (2015) and Tell Me You Love Me (2017), infused soul and mature themes. She earned a Grammy Award nomination for Confident, while ""Sorry Not Sorry"", the lead single from Tell Me You Love Me, became her highest-charting single in the U.S., reaching number six. After a hiatus, her seventh album Dancing with the Devil... the Art of Starting Over followed in 2021, which reached number two in the U.S., and her eighth album, Holy Fvck, released in 2022. On television, Lovato has starred as the titular character on the sitcom Sonny with a Chance (2009–2011), served as a judge on the music competition series The X Factor USA for its second and third seasons, and appeared as a recurring character on the musical comedy Glee (2013–2014) and the sitcom Will & Grace (2020). She also starred in the television drama film Princess Protection Program (2009), the animated comedy film Smurfs: The Lost Village (2017), and the musical comedy Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga (2020).

An activist for several social causes, Lovato's struggles with an eating disorder and substance abuse have received considerable media attention, in response to which she published the self-help memoir Staying Strong: 365 Days a Year (2013) and released the documentaries Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated (2017) and Demi Lovato: Dancing with the Devil (2021).","[['rose for', 'Mitchie Torres'],

144,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Joseph_Stalin,Joseph Stalin,"Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin (born Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili; 18 December [O.S. 6 December] 1878 – 5 March 1953) was a Georgian revolutionary and Soviet political leader who led the Soviet Union from 1924 until his death in 1953. He held power as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1922–1952) and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union (1941–1953). Initially governing the country as part of a collective leadership, he consolidated power to become a dictator by the 1930s. Ideologically adhering to the Leninist interpretation of Marxism, he formalised these ideas as Marxism–Leninism, while his own policies are called Stalinism. Born to a poor family in Gori in the Russian Empire (now Georgia), Stalin attended the Tbilisi Spiritual Seminary before joining the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. He edited the party's newspaper, Pravda, and raised funds for Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik faction via robberies, kidnappings and protection rackets. Repeatedly arrested, he underwent several internal exiles to Siberia. After the Bolsheviks seized power in the October Revolution and created a one-party state under the new Communist Party in 1917, Stalin joined its governing Politburo. Serving in the Russian Civil War before overseeing the Soviet Union's establishment in 1922, Stalin assumed leadership over the country following Lenin's death in 1924. Under Stalin, socialism in one country became a central tenet of the party's ideology. As a result of his Five-Year Plans, the country underwent agricultural collectivisation and rapid industrialisation, creating a centralised command economy. Severe disruptions to food production contributed to the famine of 1930–33 that killed millions. To eradicate accused ""enemies of the working class"", Stalin instituted the Great Purge, in which over a million were imprisoned, largely in the Gulag system of forced labour camps, and at least 700,000 executed between 1934 and 1939. By 1937, he had absolute control over the party and government. Stalin promoted Marxism–Leninism abroad through the Communist International and supported European anti-fascist movements during the 1930s, particularly in the Spanish Civil War. In 1939, his regime signed a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany, resulting in the Soviet invasion of Poland. Germany ended the pact by invading the Soviet Union in 1941. Despite initial catastrophes, the Soviet Red Army repelled the German invasion and captured Berlin in 1945, ending World War II in Europe. Amid the war, the Soviets annexed the Baltic states and Bessarabia and North Bukovina, subsequently establishing Soviet-aligned governments throughout Central and Eastern Europe and in parts of East Asia. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as global superpowers and entered a period of tension, the Cold War. Stalin presided over the Soviet post-war reconstruction and its development of an atomic bomb in 1949. During these years, the country experienced another major famine and an antisemitic campaign that culminated in the doctors' plot. After Stalin's death in 1953, he was eventually succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev, who subsequently denounced his rule and initiated the de-Stalinisation of Soviet society. Widely considered to be one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Stalin was the subject of a pervasive personality cult within the international Marxist–Leninist movement, which revered him as a champion of the working class and socialism. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Stalin has retained popularity in Russia and Georgia as a victorious wartime leader who cemented the Soviet Union's status as a leading world power. Conversely, his regime has been described as totalitarian, and has been widely condemned for overseeing mass repression, ethnic cleansing, wide-scale deportation, hundreds of thousands of executions, and famines that killed millions.","[['was', 'revolutionary'], ['was', 'Georgian'], ['was', 'political'], ['held', 'power'], ['governing country as', 'part'], ['Initially governing country as', 'part

Other major urban areas include Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod, and Kazan. The East Slavs emerged as a recognisable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries CE. Kievan Rus' arose as a state in the 9th century, and in 988, it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire. Rus' ultimately disintegrated, with the Grand Duchy of Moscow growing to become the Tsardom of Russia. By the early 18th century, Russia had vastly expanded through conquest, annexation, and the efforts of Russian explorers, developing into the Russian Empire, which remains the third-largest empire in history. However, with the Russian Revolution in 1917, Russia's monarchic rule was abolished and replaced by the Russian SFSR—the world's first constitutionally socialist state. Following the Russian Civil War, the Russian SFSR established the Soviet Union (with three other Soviet republics), within which it was the largest and principal constituent. At the expense of millions of lives, the Soviet Union underwent rapid industrialization in the 1930s, and later played a decisive role for the Allies of World War II by leading large-scale efforts on the Eastern Front. With the onset of the Cold War, it competed with the United States for global ideological influence; the Soviet era of the 20th century saw some of the most significant Russian technological achievements, including the first human-made satellite and the first human expedition into outer space. In 1991, the Russian SFSR emerged from the dissolution of the Soviet Union as the independent Russian Federation. A new constitution was adopted, and Russia has since been governed as a federal semi-presidential republic. Since the turn of the century, Russia's political system has been dominated by Vladimir Putin, under whom the country has experienced democratic backsliding and a shift towards authoritarianism. Russia has been involved militarily in a number of post-Soviet states, which has included the internationally unrecognised annexations of Crimea in 2014 from neighbouring Ukraine and four other regions in 2022 during an ongoing invasion. International rankings of Russia place it low in measurements of human rights and freedom of the press; the country also has high levels of perceived corruption. Ranked worldwide, the Russian economy stands at the ninth-largest by nominal GDP and the sixth-largest by GDP (PPP). Russia possesses the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons, and has the fifth-highest military expenditure. Its mineral and energy sources are the world's largest, and its figures for oil production and natural gas production rank high globally. The country is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council; a member state of the G20, the SCO, BRICS, the APEC, the OSCE, and the WTO; and is the leading member state of the CIS, the CSTO, and the EAEU. Russia is home to 30 UNESCO World Heritage Sites.","[['is', 'country'], ['is', 'transcontinental spanning'], ['is', 'transcontinental country'], ['is', 'largest country in world with its territory'],

146,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Philippines,Philippines,"The Philippines (/ˈfɪlɪpiːnz/; Filipino: Pilipinas), officially the Republic of the Philippines (Filipino: Republika ng Pilipinas), is an archipelagic country in Southeast Asia. It is situated in the western Pacific Ocean and consists of around 7,641 islands that are broadly categorized under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The Philippines is bounded by the South China Sea to the west, the Philippine Sea to the east, and the Celebes Sea to the southwest. It shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Japan to the northeast, Palau to the east and southeast, Indonesia to the south, Malaysia to the southwest, Vietnam to the west, and China to the northwest. The Philippines covers an area of 300,000 km2 (120,000 sq mi) and, as of 2021, it had a population of around 109 million people, making it the world's thirteenth-most populous country. The Philippines has diverse ethnicities and cultures throughout its islands. Manila is the country's capital, while the largest city is Quezon City; both lie within the urban area of Metro Manila. Negritos, some of the archipelago's earliest inhabitants, were followed by successive waves of Austronesian peoples. Adoption of animism, Hinduism and Islam established island-kingdoms called Kedatuan, Rajahnates, and Sultanates. The arrival of Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer leading a fleet for Spain, marked the beginning of Spanish colonization. In 1543, Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos named the archipelago Las Islas Filipinas in honor of Philip II of Spain. Spanish settlement through Mexico, beginning in 1565, led to the Philippines becoming ruled by the Spanish Empire for more than 300 years. During this time, Catholicism became the dominant religion, and Manila became the western hub of trans-Pacific trade. In 1896, the Philippine Revolution began, which then became entwined with the 1898 Spanish–American War. Spain ceded the territory to the United States, while Filipino revolutionaries declared the First Philippine Republic. The ensuing Philippine–American War ended with the United States establishing control over the territory, which they maintained until the Japanese invasion of the islands during World War II. Following liberation, the Philippines became independent in 1946. Since then, the unitary sovereign state has often had a tumultuous experience with democracy, which included the overthrow of a decades-long dictatorship by a nonviolent revolution. The Philippines is an emerging market and a newly industrialized country whose economy is transitioning from being agriculture centered to services and manufacturing centered. It is a founding member of the United Nations, World Trade Organization, ASEAN, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and the East Asia Summit. The location of the Philippines as an island country on the Pacific Ring of Fire that is close to the equator makes it prone to earthquakes and typhoons. The country has a variety of natural resources and is home to a globally significant level of biodiversity.","[['is country in', 'Southeast Asia'], ['is archipelagic country in', 'Southeast Asia'], ['Republic of', 'Philippines'], ['is', 'archipelagic'], ['is', 'country'], ['is', 'archipelagic country'], ['is', 'situated'], ['is situated in', 'Pacific Ocean'], ['is situated in', 'western Pacific Ocean'], ['consists of', 'around 7,641 islands'], ['is bounded Philippine Sea by', 'South China Sea'], ['is', 'bounded by South China Sea to west'], ['is bounded by', 'South China Sea'], ['shares borders to', 'north to northeast'], ['shares Palau to', 'north to northeast'], ['shares borders with', 'Taiwan'], ['shares borders to', 'Japan'], ['shares', 'borders'], ['shares borders to', 'north'], ['shares Palau to', 'Japan'], ['shares', 'Palau'], ['shares Palau to', 'north'], ['shares', 'Palau to east'], ['shares Palau with', 'Taiwan'], ['shares', 'maritime borders'], ['covers', 'area'], ['covers', 'area of 300,000 km2'], ['population of', 'around 109 million people'], ['making', ""it world 's populous country""], ['had population as', '2021'], ['had', 'population'], ['making', ""it world 's thirteenth-most country""], ['making', ""it world 's thirteenth-most populous country""], ['making', ""it world 's country""], ['had', 'population of around 109 million people'], ['has ethnicities throughout', 'its islands'], ['has', 'diverse ethnicities'], ['has', 'ethnicities'], ['maintained until', 'invasion during World War II'], ['maintained until', 'Japanese invasion of islands during World War II'], ['maintained until', 'Japanese invasion'], ['maintained until', 'Japanese invasion of islands'], ['maintained until', 'invasion of islands'], ['maintained until', 'Japanese invasion during World War II'], ['maintained until', 'invasion'], ['maintained until', 'invasion of islands during World War II'], ['became Following', 'liberation'], ['became', 'independent'], ['became in', '1946'], ['is', 'emerging'], ['is', 'emerging market'], ['is', 'market'], ['is member of', 'World Trade Organization'], ['is founding', 'Nations'], ['is member of', 'ASEAN'], ['is founding member of', 'ASEAN'], ['is', 'founding member'], ['is', 'member'], ['is member of', 'United Nations'], ['is founding member of', 'World Trade Organization'], ['is founding member of', 'Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum'], ['is founding member of', 'United Nations'], ['is member of', 'Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum'], ['prone to', 'earthquakes']]","[['countryIn', 'Southeast_Asia'], ['republicOf', 'Philippines'], ['type', 'country'], ['type', 'archipelagic_country'], ['isIn', 'Pacific_Ocean'], ['isIn', 'western_Pacific_Ocean'], ['consistsOf', 'around_7,641_islands'], ['seaBy', 'South_China_Sea'], ['seaTo', 'South_China_Sea'], ['bordersWith', 'Taiwan'], ['bordersTo', 'Japan'], ['shares', 'borders'], ['philippinesShares', 'north'], ['philippinesShares', 'Palau'], ['southTo', 'north'], ['shares', 'maritime_borders'], ['philippinesCovers', 'area'], ['mapOf', 'area'], ['coversOf', '300,000_km2'], ['populationOf', 'around_109_million_people'], ['had', 'population'], ['makingWorld', ""world_'s_thirteenth-most_country""], ['makingWorld', ""world_'s_country""], ['censusOf', 'population'], ['throughout', 'its_islands'], ['has', 'diverse_ethnicities'], ['has', 'ethnicities'], ['maintainedDuring', 'invasion'], ['maintainedDuring', 'World_War_II'], ['maintainedDuring', 'Japanese_invasion'], ['maintainedDuring', 'islands'], ['maintainedUntil', 'Japanese_invasion'], ['becauseOf', 'Japanese_invasion'], ['listOf', 'islands'], ['dateOf', 'invasion'], ['maintainedUntil', 'invasion'], ['becameFollowing', 'liberation'], ['type', 'emerging_market'], ['memberOf', 'World_Trade_Organization'], ['isFounding', 'Nations'], ['memberOf', 'ASEAN'], ['isFounding', 'founding_member'], ['type', 'member'], ['memberOf', 'United_Nations'], ['memberOf', 'Asia_Pacific_Economic_Cooperation_forum'], ['proneTo', 'earthquakes']]"

It is the tenth largest Indian state by area and the sixth largest by population. Its capital and largest city is Chennai. Tamil Nadu is the home of the Tamil people, whose Tamil language—one of the longest surviving classical languages in the world—is widely spoken in the state and serves as its official language. The state lies in the southernmost part of the Indian peninsula, and is bordered by the Indian union territory of Puducherry and the states of Kerala, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, as well as an international maritime border with Sri Lanka. It is bounded by the Western Ghats in the west, the Eastern Ghats in the north, the Bay of Bengal in the east, the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Strait to the south-east, and the Indian Ocean in the south. The at-large Tamilakam region that has been inhabited by Tamils was under several regimes, such as the Sangam era rulers of the Chera, Chola, and Pandya clans, the Pallava dynasty, and the later Vijayanagara Empire, all of which shaped the state's cuisine, culture, and architecture. After the fall of the Kingdom of Mysore, the British colonised the region and administered it as part of the Madras Presidency, headquartered at the city of Madras, now known as Chennai. After India's Independence in 1947, the Madras State came into existence, whose borders were linguistically redrawn by the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, losing territory to Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The state was renamed as Tamil Nadu in 1969. It is home to a number of historic buildings, multi-religious pilgrimage sites, hill stations and three World Heritage Sites. The economy of Tamil Nadu is the second-largest in India, with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of ₹24.85 lakh crore (US$310 billion) and has the country's 11th-highest GSDP per capita of ₹225,106 (US$2,800). It ranks 11th among all Indian states in human development index. Tamil Nadu is the most urbanised state in India, and one of the most industrialised states; the manufacturing sector accounts for more than one-third of the state's GDP. Its tourism industry is the largest among the Indian states. The Tamil film industry plays an influential role in the state's popular culture.","[['is', 'state'], ['is state in', 'southern India'], ['is state in', 'India'], ['is tenth state by', 'area'], ['is tenth Indian state by', 'area'], ['is', 'tenth state'], ['is', 'Indian state'], ['is', 'state'], ['is state by', 'area'], ['is', 'tenth Indian state'], ['is Indian state by', 'area'], ['is home of', 'Tamil people'], ['is', 'home'], ['is bounded by', 'Western Ghats'], ['is bounded by', 'Ghats in west'], ['is bounded by', 'Western Ghats in west'], ['is bounded by', 'Ghats'], ['is', 'home'], ['ranks among', 'Indian states'], ['ranks 11th among', 'Indian states'], ['is urbanised state in', 'India'], ['is most urbanised state in', 'India'], ['is state in', 'India'], ['is', 'state'], ['is', 'most urbanised state'], ['is', 'urbanised state']]","[['type', 'state'], ['isIn', 'southern_India'], ['stateIn', 'India'], ['stateBy', 'area'], ['type', 'tenth_state'], ['type', 'Indian_state'], ['type', 'tenth_Indian_state'], ['homeOf', 'Tamil_people'], ['type', 'home'], ['boundedBy', 'Western_Ghats'], ['isIn', 'Ghats'], ['stateIn', 'west'], ['isIn', 'Western_Ghats'], ['surroundedBy', 'Ghats'], ['ranksAmong', 'Indian_states'], ['type', 'most_urbanised_state'], ['type', 'urbanised_state']]"

She was educated privately at home and began to undertake public duties during the Second World War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In November 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, a former prince of Greece and Denmark, and their marriage lasted 73 years until his death in 2021. They had four children: Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward. When her father died in February 1952, Elizabeth—then 25 years old—became queen of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon (known today as Sri Lanka), as well as head of the Commonwealth. Elizabeth reigned as a constitutional monarch through major political changes such as the Troubles in Northern Ireland, devolution in the United Kingdom, the decolonisation of Africa, and the United Kingdom's accession to the European Communities and withdrawal from the European Union. The number of her realms varied over time as territories gained independence and some realms became republics. As queen, Elizabeth was served by more than 170 prime ministers across her realms. Her many historic visits and meetings included state visits to China in 1986, to Russia in 1994, and to the Republic of Ireland in 2011, and meetings with five popes. Significant events included Elizabeth's coronation in 1953 and the celebrations of her Silver, Golden, Diamond, and Platinum jubilees in 1977, 2002, 2012, and 2022, respectively. Although she faced occasional republican sentiment and media criticism of her family—particularly after the breakdowns of her children's marriages, her annus horribilis in 1992, and the death in 1997 of her former daughter-in-law Diana—support for the monarchy in the United Kingdom remained consistently high throughout her lifetime, as did her personal popularity. Elizabeth died at Balmoral Castle, Aberdeenshire, in September 2022, at the age of 96, and was succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III. Her state funeral was the first to be held in the United Kingdom since that of Winston Churchill in 1965.","[['is in', '2022'], ['was head of', '15 realms'], ['was', 'regnant of 32 sovereign states during her lifetime'], ['was queen regnant during', 'her lifetime'], ['was head of', '15 realms at time of her death'], ['was queen regnant of', '32 states'], ['was head of', '15 realms at time'], ['was regnant of', '32 states'], ['was', 'head'], ['was head of', 'state'], ['was', 'head of state of 15 realms'], ['was', 'head of state of 15 realms at time'], ['was regnant of', '32 sovereign states'], ['was', 'queen regnant of 32 sovereign states during her lifetime'], ['was regnant during', 'her lifetime'], ['was', 'queen regnant of 32 states during her lifetime'], ['was queen regnant of', '32 sovereign states'], ['was', 'regnant'], ['was', 'regnant of 32 states during her lifetime'], ['was', 'queen regnant'], ['was', 'head of state of 15 realms at time of her death'], ['was', 'born in Mayfair as child of Duke'], ['was born as', 'later King George VI'], ['was born as', 'child'], ['was', 'born in Mayfair as first child'], ['was born as', 'first child of Duke'], ['was', 'born in Mayfair as first child of Duke'], ['was', 'born in Mayfair as child'], ['was born as', 'first child'], ['was', 'born in Mayfair as first child of Duke of York'], ['was born as', 'child of Duke'], ['was born as', 'child of Duke of York'], ['was', 'born in Mayfair as child of Duke of York'], ['was born as', 'first child of Duke of York'], ['was', 'born'], ['was born as', 'King George VI'], ['was born in', 'Mayfair'], ['was born in', 'London'], ['was educated at', 'home'], ['was educated privately at', 'home'], ['was', 'educated'], ['was', 'educated privately'], ['married', 'former prince of Greece'], ['married Philip Mountbatten In', 'November 1947'], ['married', 'Philip Mountbatten'], ['married', 'former prince'], ['had', 'four children'], ['reigned as', 'monarch'], ['reigned through', 'major changes'], ['reigned through', 'political changes'], ['reigned through', 'major political changes'], ['reigned through', 'changes'], ['reigned as', 'constitutional monarch'], ['has', 'coronation in 1953'], ['faced sentiment after', ""breakdowns of her children 's marriages""], ['faced', 'occasional sentiment'], ['faced sentiment after', 'breakdowns'], ['is in', '1997'], ['faced sentiment after', 'particularly breakdowns'], ['faced sentiment after', ""particularly breakdowns of her children 's marriages""], ['faced', 'sentiment'], ['faced', 'occasional republican sentiment'], ['faced', 'republican sentiment'], ['was succeeded by', 'her eldest son'], ['died at', 'age of 96'], ['was succeeded by', 'her son'], ['son', 'Charles III'], ['was succeeded by', 'Charles III'], ['died at', 'age'], ['died in', 'September 2022'], ['died at', 'Aberdeenshire'], ['died at', 'Balmoral Castle']]","[['headOf', '15_realms'], ['reignedDuring', '32_sovereign_states'], ['diedDuring', 'lifetime'], ['headOf', 'time'], ['asOf', 'death'], ['queenOf', '32_states'], ['at', '15_realms'], ['at', 'time'], ['type', 'head'], ['headOf', 'state'], ['houseOf', 'head'], ['at', 'head'], ['at', 'state'], ['consistedOf', '32_sovereign_states'], ['diedDuring', 'queen'], ['reignedDuring', '32_states'], ['of', 'Mayfair'], ['motherOf', 'child'], ['daughterOf', 'Duke'], ['bornAs', 'later_King_George_VI'], ['diedAs', 'child'], ['knownAs', 'Mayfair'], ['diedAs', 'first_child'], ['motherOf', 'first_child'], ['duchessOf', 'York'], ['bornAs', 'King_George_VI'], ['diedIn', 'London'], ['diedAt', 'home'], ['daughterOf', 'former_prince'], ['princessOf', 'Greece'], ['diedIn', 'November'], ['married', 'Philip_Mountbatten'], ['married', 'former_prince'], ['had', 'four_children'], ['reignedAs', 'monarch'], ['reignedThrough', 'major_changes'], ['reignedThrough', 'political_changes'], ['reignedThrough', 'major_political_changes'], ['reignedThrough', 'changes'], ['reignedAs', 'constitutional_monarch'], ['has', 'coronation'], ['complainedOf', 'breakdowns'], ['breakdownOf', ""children_'s_marriages""], ['faced', 'occasional_sentiment'], ['facedAfter', 'breakdowns'], ['after', 'particularly_breakdowns'], ['complainedOf', 'particularly_breakdowns'], ['faced', 'sentiment'], ['faced', 'occasional_republican_sentiment'], ['faced', 'republican_sentiment'], ['succeededBy', 'eldest_son'], ['diedAt', 'age'], ['succeededBy', 'son'], ['charlesIii', 'Charles_III'], ['succeededBy', 'Charles_III'], ['diedIn', 'September'], ['diedAt', 'Aberdeenshire'], ['diedAt', 'Balmoral_Castle']]"
150,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Mahatma_Gandhi,Mahatma Gandhi,"Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (/ˈɡɑːndi, ˈɡændi/; GAHN-dee; 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule, and to later inspire movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: ""great-souled"", ""venerable""), first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa, is now used throughout the world. Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. It was here that Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination. Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and, above all, achieving swaraj or self-rule. Gandhi adopted the short dhoti woven with hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor. He began to live in a self-sufficient residential community, to eat simple food, and undertake long fasts as a means of both introspection and political protest. Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930 and in calling for the British to quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned many times and for many years in both South Africa and India. Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism was challenged in the early 1940s by a Muslim nationalism which demanded a separate homeland for Muslims within British India. In August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority Pakistan. As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Abstaining from the official celebration of independence, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to alleviate distress. In the months following, he undertook several hunger strikes to stop the religious violence. The last of these, begun in Delhi on 12 January 1948 when he was 78, also had the indirect goal of pressuring India to pay out some cash assets owed to Pakistan. Although the Government of India relented, as did the religious rioters, the belief that Gandhi had been too resolute in his defence of both Pakistan and Indian Muslims, especially those besieged in Delhi, spread among some Hindus in India. Among these was Nathuram Godse, a militant Hindu nationalist from western India, who assassinated Gandhi by firing three bullets into his chest at an interfaith prayer meeting in Delhi on 30 January 1948. Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and worldwide as the International Day of Nonviolence. Gandhi is commonly, though not formally, considered the Father of the Nation in India and was commonly called Bapu (Gujarati: endearment for father, papa).","[['later inspire', 'movements for

151,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/MacOS,MacOS,"macOS (/ˌmækoʊˈɛs/; previously OS X and originally Mac OS X) is a Unix operating system developed and marketed by Apple Inc. since 2001. It is the primary operating system for Apple's Mac computers. Within the market of desktop and laptop computers it is the second most widely used desktop OS, after Microsoft Windows and ahead of ChromeOS. macOS succeeded the classic Mac OS, a Mac operating system with nine releases from 1984 to 1999. During this time, Apple cofounder Steve Jobs had left Apple and started another company, NeXT, developing the NeXTSTEP platform that would later be acquired by Apple to form the basis of macOS. The first desktop version, Mac OS X 10.0, was released in March 2001, with its first update, 10.1, arriving later that year. All releases from Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard and after are UNIX 03 certified, with an exception for OS X 10.7 Lion. Apple's mobile operating system, iOS, has been considered a variant of macOS. A prominent part of macOS's original brand identity was the use of Roman numeral X, pronounced ""ten"" as in Mac OS X and also the iPhone X, as well as code naming each release after species of big cats, or places within California. Apple shortened the name to ""OS X"" in 2011 and then changed it to ""macOS"" in 2016 to align with the branding of Apple's other operating systems, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. After sixteen distinct versions of macOS 10, macOS Big Sur was presented as version 11 in 2020, macOS Monterey was presented as version 12 in 2021, and macOS Ventura was presented as version 13 in 2022. macOS has supported three major processor architectures, beginning with PowerPC-based Macs in 1999. In 2006, Apple transitioned to the Intel architecture with a line of Macs using Intel Core processors. In 2020, Apple began the Apple silicon transition, using self-designed, 64-bit ARM-based Apple M1 processors on the latest Macintosh computers.","[['developed since', '2001'], ['developed by', 'Apple

152,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Kobe_Bryant,Kobe Bryant,"Kobe Bean Bryant (/ˈkoʊbiː/ KOH-bee; August 23, 1978 – January 26, 2020) was an American professional basketball player. A shooting guard, he spent his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players and scorers of all time, Bryant won five NBA championships, was an 18-time All-Star, a 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, a 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team, the 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), and a two-time NBA Finals MVP. Bryant also led the NBA in scoring twice, and ranks fourth in league all-time regular season and postseason scoring. He was posthumously voted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020 and named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021. The son of former NBA player Joe Bryant, he was born in Philadelphia and partly raised in Italy. Recognized as the top American high-school basketball player while at Philadelphia suburb Lower Merion, Bryant declared for the 1996 NBA draft and was selected by the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th overall pick; he was then traded to the Lakers. As a rookie, Bryant earned a reputation as a high-flyer by winning the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest, and was named an All-Star by his second season. Despite a feud with teammate Shaquille O'Neal, the pair led the Lakers to three consecutive NBA championships from 2000 to 2002. In 2003, Bryant was charged with sexual assault; with the alleged victim being a 19-year-old hotel employee. Criminal charges were later dropped after the accuser failed to testify, and a lawsuit was settled out of court, with Bryant issuing a public apology and admitting to a sexual encounter he maintained was consensual. The accusation briefly tarnished Bryant's reputation, resulting in the loss of several of his endorsement contracts. After the Lakers lost the 2004 NBA Finals, O'Neal was traded and Bryant became the cornerstone of the franchise. He led the NBA in scoring in the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons and was named league MVP in 2008. On January 22, 2006, he scored a career-high 81 points; the second most points scored in a single NBA game, behind Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game. Bryant led the team to consecutive championships in 2009 and 2010, both times being named NBA Finals MVP. He continued to be among the top players in the league through the 2012–13 season, when he suffered a torn achilles tendon at age 34. His next two seasons were cut short by injuries to his knee and shoulder, respectively. Citing physical decline, Bryant retired after the 2015–16 season. In 2017, the Lakers retired both his Nos. 8 and 24, making him the only player in NBA history to have multiple numbers retired by the same franchise. The all-time leading scorer in Lakers history, Bryant was the first guard in NBA history to play 20 seasons. His 18 All-Star designations are the second most all time, and he has the most consecutive appearances as a starter. Bryant's four NBA All-Star Game MVP Awards are tied with Bob Pettit for the most in NBA history. He gave himself the nickname ""Black Mamba"" in the mid-2000s, and the epithet became widely adopted by the general public. He won gold medals on the 2008 and 2012 U.S. Olympic teams. In 2018, he won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for the film Dear Basketball (2017). Bryant died, along with his daughter Gianna and seven others, in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California, in 2020. A number of tributes and memorials were subsequently issued, including renaming the All-Star MVP Award in his honor.","[['was', 'American'], ['was', 'professional'], ['spent', 'his entire 20 year

153,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Kim_Kardashian,Kim Kardashian,"Kimberly Noel Kardashian (formerly West; born October 21, 1980) is an American socialite, media personality, and businesswoman. She first gained media attention as a friend and stylist of Paris Hilton, but received wider notice after the sex tape Kim Kardashian, Superstar, shot in 2003 with her then-boyfriend Ray J, was released in 2007. Later that year, she and her family began to appear in the E! reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians (2007–2021). Its success led to the formation of the spin-off series Kourtney and Kim Take New York (2011–2012), Kourtney and Kim Take Miami (2009–2013), and Hulu's The Kardashians (2022). Kardashian has developed a significant presence online and across numerous social media platforms, including hundreds of millions of followers on Twitter and Instagram. With sisters Kourtney and Khloé, she launched the fashion boutique chain Dash, which operated from 2006 to 2018. Kardashian founded KKW Beauty and KKW Fragrance in 2017, and the shaping underwear or foundation garment company Skims in 2019. She has released a variety of products tied to her name, including the 2014 mobile game Kim Kardashian: Hollywood and the 2015 photo book Selfish. As an actress, she has appeared in the films Disaster Movie (2008), Deep in the Valley (2009), and Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor (2013), and provided her voice for PAW Patrol: The Movie (2021). Time magazine included Kardashian on their list of 2015's 100 most influential people. Both critics and admirers have described her as exemplifying the notion of being famous for being famous. She is estimated to be worth US$1.8 billion, as of 2022. Kardashian has become more politically active by lobbying for prison reform and clemency, and is currently under a four-year law apprenticeship supervised by the legal nonprofit #cut50. Her relationship with rapper Kanye West has also received significant media coverage; they were married from 2014 to 2022 and have four children together.","[['is', 'American'], ['began at_time', 'year'], ['began at_time', 'Later year'], ['Take', 'Miami 2009'], ['Take', 'New York'], ['has developed', 'presence online'], ['has developed', 'significant presence online'], ['launched fashion boutique chain Dash With', 'sisters Kourtney'], ['launched', 'fashion boutique chain Dash'], ['founded', 'KKW Beauty'], ['founded KKW Beauty in', '2017'], ['has appeared in', 'films Disaster Movie'], ['has appeared As', 'actress'], ['has appeared in', '2008'], ['is estimated', 'to worth'], ['is estimated', 'worth'], ['is', 'estimated'], ['is under', 'currently four year law apprenticeship supervised by legal #cut50'], ['is under', 'four year law apprenticeship supervised by #cut50'], ['has become', 'politically active'], ['is under', 'four year law apprenticeship supervised by legal #cut50'], ['is under', 'four year law apprenticeship supervised by legal nonprofit #cut50'], ['is under', 'currently four year law apprenticeship supervised by legal nonprofit #cut50'], ['is under', 'four year law apprenticeship supervised by nonprofit #cut50'], ['is under', 'currently four year law apprenticeship supervised by nonprofit #cut50'], ['is under', 'currently four year law apprenticeship'], ['is under', 'four year law apprenticeship'], ['is under', 'currently four year law apprenticeship supervised by #cut50'], ['has become', 'more politically active'], ['is under', 'currently four year law apprenticeship supervised'], ['has become', 'more active'], ['has become', 'active'], ['is under', 'four year law apprenticeship supervised'], ['were married to', '2022'], ['have together', 'four children'], ['have', 'four children'], ['were', 'married'], ['were', 'married from 2014 to 2022'], ['were married from', '2014']]","[['began', 'year'], ['beganYear', 'Later_year'], ['Take', 'Miami'], ['Take', 'New_York'], ['developed', 'presence'], ['developed', 'significant_presence'], ['dashWith', 'sisters_Kourtney'], ['launched', 'fashion_boutique_chain_Dash'], ['founded', 'KKW_Beauty'], ['appearedIn', 'films_Disaster_Movie'], ['appearsAs', 'actress'], ['isBy', 'four_year_law_apprenticeship'], ['supervisedBy', 'legal_#'], ['supervisedBy', 'cut50'], ['supervisedBy', 'legal_nonprofit'], ['isBy', 'currently_four_year_law_apprenticeship'], ['supervisedBy', 'nonprofit_#'], ['under', 'currently_four_year_law_apprenticeship'], ['isUnder', 'four_year_law_apprenticeship'], ['isSupervised', 'four_year_law_apprenticeship'], ['have', 'four_children']]"
154,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire,Ottoman Empire,"The Ottoman Empire, also known as the Turkish Empire, was an empire that controlled much of Southeast Europe, Western Asia, and Northern Africa between the 14th and early 20th centuries. It was founded at the end of the 13th century in northwestern Anatolia in the town of Söğüt (modern-day Bilecik Province) by the Turkoman tribal leader Osman I. After 1354, the Ottomans crossed into Europe and, with the conquest of the Balkans, the Ottoman beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire. The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the conquest of Constantinople in 1453 by Mehmed the Conqueror. Under the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman Empire marked the peak of its power and prosperity, as well as the highest development of its governmental, social, and economic systems. At the beginning of the 17th century, the empire contained 32 provinces and numerous vassal states. Some of these were later absorbed into the Ottoman Empire, while others were granted various types of autonomy over the course of centuries. With Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) as its capital and control of lands around the Mediterranean Basin, the Ottoman Empire was at the centre of interactions between the Middle East and Europe for six centuries. While the empire was once thought to have entered a period of decline following the death of Suleiman the Magnificent, this view is no longer supported by the majority of academic historians. The newer academic consensus posits that the empire continued to maintain a flexible and strong economy, society and military throughout the 17th and for much of the 18th century. However, during a long period of peace from 1740 to 1768, the Ottoman military system fell behind that of its European rivals, the Habsburg and Russian empires. The Ottomans consequently suffered severe military defeats in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The successful Greek War of Independence concluded with decolonization of Greece following the London Protocol (1830) and Treaty of Constantinople (1832). This and other defeats prompted the Ottoman state to initiate a comprehensive process of reform and modernization known as the Tanzimat. Thus, over the course of the 19th century, the Ottoman state became vastly more powerful and organized internally, despite suffering further territorial losses, especially in the Balkans, where a number of new states emerged. The Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) established the Second Constitutional Era in the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, turning the Empire into a constitutional monarchy, which conducted competitive multi-party elections. However, after the disastrous Balkan Wars, the now radicalized and nationalistic CUP took over the government in the 1913 coup d'état, creating a one-party regime. The CUP allied the Empire with Germany, hoping to escape from the diplomatic isolation which had contributed to its recent territorial losses, and thus joined World War I on the side of the Central Powers. While the Empire was able to largely hold its own during the conflict, it was struggling with internal dissent, especially with the Arab Revolt in its Arabian holdings. During this time, the Ottoman government engaged in genocide against the Armenians, Assyrians, and Greeks. The Empire's defeat and the occupation of part of its territory by the Allied Powers in the aftermath of World War I resulted in its partitioning and the loss of its Middle Eastern territories, which were divided between the United Kingdom and France. The successful Turkish War of Independence, led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk against the occupying Allies, led to the emergence of the Republic of Turkey in the Anatolian heartland and the abolition of the Ottoman monarchy.","[['known as', 'Empire'], ['also known as', 'Turkish Empire'], ['also known as', 'Empire'], ['was', 'empire'], ['known as', 'Turkish Empire'], ['was', 'founded at end of century

It is controlled by The Football Association (FA), the governing body for football in England, which is affiliated with UEFA and comes under the global jurisdiction of world football's governing body FIFA. England competes in the three major international tournaments contested by European nations: the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA European Championship, and the UEFA Nations League. England is the joint oldest national team in football having played in the world's first international football match in 1872, against Scotland. England's home ground is Wembley Stadium, London, and its training headquarters is St George's Park, Burton upon Trent. The team's manager is Gareth Southgate. England won the 1966 World Cup Final (a tournament it also hosted), making it one of eight nations to have won the World Cup. They have qualified for the World Cup 16 times, and their best other performance are finishing fourth in both 1990 and 2018.

156,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Tom_Brady,Tom Brady,"Thomas Edward Patrick Brady Jr. (born August 3, 1977) is an American football quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League (NFL). He spent his first 20 seasons with the New England Patriots organization, with which he was a central contributor to the franchise's dynasty from 2001 to 2019. Brady is widely regarded as the greatest quarterback of all time. After playing college football at Michigan, Brady was selected 199th overall by the Patriots in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft, later earning him a reputation as the NFL's biggest draft steal. He became the starting quarterback during his second season, which saw the Patriots win their first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XXXVI. As the team's primary starter for 18 seasons, Brady led the Patriots to 17 division titles (including 11 consecutive from 2009 to 2019), 13 AFC Championship Games (including eight consecutive from 2011 to 2018), nine Super Bowl appearances, and six Super Bowl titles, all NFL records for a player and franchise. He joined the Buccaneers in 2020 and led them to win Super Bowl LV, extending his individual records to ten Super Bowl appearances and seven victories. Brady holds nearly every major quarterback record, including passing yards, completions, touchdown passes, and games started. Never having a losing season, he is the NFL leader in career quarterback wins, quarterback regular season wins, quarterback playoff wins, and Super Bowl MVP awards, as well as being the only Super Bowl MVP for two different franchises. Additional accolades held by Brady include the most Pro Bowl selections and the first unanimous NFL MVP. The only quarterback to win a Super Bowl in three separate decades, Brady is also noted for the longevity of his success. He is the oldest NFL MVP at age 40, the oldest Super Bowl MVP at age 43, and the oldest quarterback selected to the Pro Bowl at age 44. Brady is the only NFL quarterback named to two all-decade teams (2000s and 2010s) and was unanimously named to the 100th Anniversary All-Time Team in 2019.","[['is American', 'Buccaneers'], ['spent', 'his first 20 seasons'], ['was', ""central contributor to franchise 's dynasty from 2001 to 2019""], ['was central contributor to', ""franchise 's dynasty""], ['was contributor to', ""franchise 's dynasty""], ['was', ""contributor to franchise 's dynasty from 2001 to 2019""], ['spent', 'his 20 seasons'], ['was contributor from', '2001 to 2019'], ['was', 'contributor'], ['was central contributor from', '2001 to 2019'], ['was central', 'dynasty'], ['was', 'central contributor'], ['is widely regarded as', 'quarterback of time'], ['is widely regarded as', 'greatest quarterback of time'], ['is regarded as', 'greatest quarterback of time'], ['is', 'regarded'], ['is regarded as', 'quarterback of time'], ['is', 'widely regarded'], ['became during', 'his season'], ['became', 'starting quarterback'], ['became', 'quarterback'], ['became during', 'his second season'], ['led Patriots As', ""team 's primary starter""], ['led', 'Patriots'], ['led Patriots As', ""team 's starter for 18 seasons""], ['led Patriots As', ""team 's starter""], ['led Patriots to', '17 division titles including 11 consecutive'], ['led Patriots to', '17 division titles including 11 consecutive from 2009 to 2019'], ['led Patriots As', ""team 's primary starter for 18 seasons""], ['led Patriots to', '17 division titles'], ['joined', 'Buccaneers'], ['joined Buccaneers in', '2020'], ['win', 'Super Bowl LV'], ['led', 'them'], ['having', 'season'], ['is', 'NFL leader'], ['is', 'NFL leader in career quarterback'], ['having', 'losing season'], ['is', 'NFL MVP'], ['is', 'NFL MVP at age 40'], ['is', 'oldest NFL MVP'], ['is', 'oldest NFL MVP at age 40'], ['was unanimously named in', '2019'], ['was', 'named'], ['is', 'NFL quarterback'], ['was named to', '100th Anniversary'], ['was', 'named to 100th Anniversary in 2019'], ['was unanimously named to', '100th Anniversary'], ['was named in', '2019'], ['was', 'named to Anniversary in 2019'], ['is', 'only NFL quarterback named'], ['was', 'unanimously named to 100th Anniversary in 2019'], ['was named to', 'Anniversary'], ['was', 'unanimously named'], ['was', 'unanimously named to Anniversary in 2019'], ['is', 'NFL quarterback named to two decade teams'], ['is', 'NFL quarterback named'], ['was unanimously named to', 'Anniversary'], ['is', 'only NFL quarterback'], ['is', 'only NFL quarterback named to two decade teams']]","[['american', 'Buccaneers'], ['spent', 'his_first_20_seasons'], ['returnedTo', 'central_contributor'], ['contributedTo', ""franchise_'s_dynasty""], ['to', 'contributor'], ['spent', 'his_20_seasons'], ['type', 'contributor'], ['central', 'dynasty'], ['type', 'central_contributor'], ['sonOf', 'quarterback'], ['quarterbackOf', 'time'], ['isOf', 'greatest_quarterback'], ['becameDuring', 'his_season'], ['becameStarting', 'quarterback'], ['became', 'quarterback'], ['becameDuring', 'his_second_season'], ['finishedAs', ""team_'s_primary_starter""], ['led', 'Patriots'], ['ranFor', ""team_'s_starter""], ['starterFor', '18_seasons'], ['resignedAs', ""team_'s_starter""], ['ledTo', '17_division_titles'], ['ranFor', ""team_'s_primary_starter""], ['joined', 'Buccaneers'], ['patriotsWin', 'Super_Bowl_LV'], ['hadLed', 'them'], ['bradyHaving', 'season'], ['type', 'NFL_leader'], ['isIn', 'NFL_leader'], ['leaderIn', 'career_quarterback'], ['havingLosing', 'season'], ['type', 'NFL_MVP'], ['isAt', 'NFL_MVP'], ['diedAt', 'age'], ['type', 'oldest_NFL_MVP'], ['isAt', 'oldest_NFL_MVP'], ['former', 'NFL_quarterback'], ['namedTo', '100th_Anniversary'], ['namedTo', 'Anniversary'], ['type', 'only_NFL_quarterback'], ['namedTo', 'NFL_quarterback'], ['namedTo', 'two_decade_teams'], ['isTo', 'only_NFL_quarterback']]"

158,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/George_V,George V,"George V (George Frederick Ernest Albert; 3 June 1865 – 20 January 1936) was King of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions, and Emperor of India, from 6 May 1910 until his death in 1936. Born during the reign of his grandmother Queen Victoria, George was the second son of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, and was third in the line of succession to the British throne behind his father and his elder brother, Prince Albert Victor. From 1877 to 1892, George served in the Royal Navy, until the unexpected death of his elder brother in early 1892 put him directly in line for the throne. On Victoria's death in 1901, George's father ascended the throne as Edward VII, and George was created Prince of Wales. He became king-emperor on his father's death in 1910. George's reign saw the rise of socialism, communism, fascism, Irish republicanism, and the Indian independence movement, all of which radically changed the political landscape of the British Empire, which itself reached its territorial peak by the beginning of the 1920s. The Parliament Act 1911 established the supremacy of the elected British House of Commons over the unelected House of Lords. As a result of the First World War (1914–1918), the empires of his first cousins Nicholas II of Russia and Wilhelm II of Germany fell, while the British Empire expanded to its greatest effective extent. In 1917, George became the first monarch of the House of Windsor, which he renamed from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha as a result of anti-German public sentiment. He appointed the first Labour ministry in 1924, and the 1931 Statute of Westminster recognised the Empire's dominions as separate, independent states within the British Commonwealth of Nations. George suffered from smoking-related health problems throughout much of his later reign. On his death in January 1936, he was succeeded by his eldest son, Edward VIII. Edward abdicated in December of that year and was succeeded by his younger brother Albert, who took the regnal name George VI.","[['is in', '1936'], ['was son of', 'Albert Edward'], ['was second son

159,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Michael_Jordan,Michael Jordan,"Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963), also known by his initials MJ, is an American businessman and former professional basketball player. His biography on the official NBA website states: ""By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time."" He played fifteen seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA), winning six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls. Jordan is the principal owner and chairman of the Charlotte Hornets of the NBA and of 23XI Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series. He was integral in popularizing the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s, becoming a global cultural icon in the process. Jordan played college basketball for three seasons under coach Dean Smith with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982. Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick, and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the game's best defensive players. His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames ""Air Jordan"" and ""His Airness"". Jordan won his first NBA title with the Bulls in 1991, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a three-peat. Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the 1993–94 NBA season to play Minor League Baseball but returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season. He retired for the second time in January 1999 but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Washington Wizards. During the course of his professional career he was also selected to play for the United States national team, winning four gold medals (at the 1983 Pan American Games, 1984 Summer Olympics, 1992 Tournament of the Americas and 1992 Summer Olympics), while also being undefeated. Jordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include six NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards, ten NBA scoring titles (both all-time records), five NBA MVP awards, ten All-NBA First Team designations, nine All-Defensive First Team honors, fourteen NBA All-Star Game selections, three NBA All-Star Game MVP awards, three NBA steals titles, and the 1988 NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award. He holds the NBA records for career regular season scoring average (30.12 points per game) and career playoff scoring average (33.45 points per game). In 1999, he was named the 20th century's greatest North American athlete by ESPN, and was second to Babe Ruth on the Associated Press' list of athletes of the century. Jordan was twice inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, once in 2009 for his individual career, and again in 2010 as part of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team (""The Dream Team""). He became a member of the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 2009, a member of the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 2010, and an individual member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2015 and a ""Dream Team"" member in 2017. In 2021, Jordan was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. One of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation, Jordan is known for his product endorsements. He fueled the success of Nike's Air Jordan sneakers, which were introduced in 1984 and remain popular today. Jordan also starred as himself in the 1996 live-action animation hybrid film Space Jam and is the central focus of the Emmy Award-winning documentary miniseries The Last Dance (2020). He became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the Charlotte Bobcats (now named the Hornets) in 2006, and bought a controlling interest in 2010. In 2016, Jordan became the first billionaire player in NBA history. That year, President Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. As of 2022, Jordan's net worth is estimated at $1.7 billion.","[['is', 'basketball player of time'], ['is', 'By acclamation basketball player of time'], ['is', 'By acclamation greatest basketball

160,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Pakistan,Pakistan,"Pakistan (Urdu: پاکِستان [ˈpaːkɪstaːn]) , officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (Urdu: اِسلامیجمہوریہ پاکِستان), is a country in South Asia. It is the world's fifth-most populous country, with a population of almost 243 million people, and has the world's second-largest Muslim population just behind Indonesia. Pakistan is the 33rd-largest country in the world by area and 2nd largest in South Asia, spanning 881,913 square kilometres (340,509 square miles). It has a 1,046-kilometre (650-mile) coastline along the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman in the south, and is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest, and China to the northeast. It is separated narrowly from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's Wakhan Corridor in the north, and also shares a maritime border with Oman. Islamabad is the nation's capital, while Karachi is its largest city and financial centre. Pakistan is the site of several ancient cultures, including the 8,500-year-old Neolithic site of Mehrgarh in Balochistan, the Indus Valley civilisation of the Bronze Age, the most extensive of the civilisations of the Afro-Eurasia, and the ancient Gandhara civilization. The region that comprises the modern state of Pakistan was the realm of multiple empires and dynasties, including the Achaemenid; briefly that of Alexander the Great; the Seleucid, the Maurya, the Kushan, the Gupta; the Umayyad Caliphate in its southern regions, the Hindu Shahis, the Ghaznavids, the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughals, the Durranis, the Sikh Empire, British East India Company rule, and most recently, the British Indian Empire from 1858 to 1947. Spurred by the Pakistan Movement, which sought a homeland for the Muslims of British India, and election victories in 1946 by the All-India Muslim League, Pakistan gained independence in 1947 after the Partition of the British Indian Empire, which awarded separate statehood to its Muslim-majority regions and was accompanied by an unparalleled mass migration and loss of life. Initially a Dominion of the British Commonwealth, Pakistan officially drafted its constitution in 1956, and emerged as a declared Islamic republic. In 1971, the exclave of East Pakistan seceded as the new country of Bangladesh after a nine-month-long civil war. In the following four decades, Pakistan has been ruled by governments whose descriptions, although complex, commonly alternated between civilian and military, democratic and authoritarian, relatively secular and Islamist. Pakistan elected a civilian government in 2008, and in 2010 adopted a parliamentary system with periodic elections. Pakistan is a middle power nation, and has the world's sixth-largest standing armed forces. It is a declared nuclear-weapons state, and is ranked amongst the emerging and growth-leading economies, with a large and rapidly-growing middle class. Pakistan's political history since independence has been characterised by periods of significant economic and military growth as well as those of political and economic instability. It is an ethnically and linguistically diverse country, with similarly diverse geography and wildlife. The country continues to face challenges, including poverty, illiteracy, corruption and terrorism. Pakistan is a member of the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Commonwealth of Nations, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, and the Islamic Military Counter-Terrorism Coalition, and is designated as a major non-NATO ally by the United States.","[['is in', 'South Asia'], ['is country in', 'South Asia'], ['is',

161,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Steve_Jobs,Steve Jobs,"Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American entrepreneur, industrial designer, media proprietor, and investor. He was the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple; the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. He is widely recognized as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and German-American mother. He was adopted shortly after his birth. Jobs attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics. In 1985, Jobs was forced out of Apple after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO, John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took a few Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, he helped to develop the visual effects industry when he funded the computer graphics division of George Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986. The new company was Pixar, which produced the first 3D computer-animated feature film Toy Story (1995) and went on to become a major animation studio, producing over 25 films since. In 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company's acquisition of NeXT. He was largely responsible for reviving Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with English designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning with the ""Think different"" advertising campaign and leading to the Apple Store, App Store (iOS), iMac, iPad, iPod, iPhone, iTunes, and iTunes Store. In 2001, the original Mac OS was replaced with the completely new Mac OS X (now known as macOS), based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP platform, giving the operating system a modern Unix-based foundation for the first time. In 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. He died of respiratory arrest related to the tumor on October 5, 2011, at the age of 56. In 2022, he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.","[['was', 'American'], ['member of', ""Walt Disney Company 's board of directors""], ['member following', 'its acquisition of

162,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/LeBron_James,LeBron James,"LeBron Raymone James Sr. (/ləˈbrɒn/; born December 30, 1984) is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed ""King James"", he is widely considered one of the greatest players ever and is often compared to Michael Jordan in debates over the greatest basketball player of all time. James has won four NBA championships, four NBA MVP awards, four NBA Finals MVP awards, three All-Star MVP awards, and two Olympic gold medals. James has scored the most points in the playoffs, the most career points (playoffs and regular seasons combined), and the second most regular seasons points, and has the seventh most career assists. He has been selected an NBA All-Star 18 times, to the All-NBA Team a record 18 times, and to the NBA All-Defensive First Team five times. He has competed in 10 NBA Finals, the third most all time, including eight consecutively between 2011 and 2018 (first four with Miami, second four with Cleveland). In 2021, James was selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team, and in 2022 became the first and only player in NBA history to accumulate over 10,000 career points, rebounds, and assists. James played basketball for St. Vincent–St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio, and was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar. A prep-to-pro, he was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft. Named the 2004 NBA Rookie of the Year, he soon established himself as one of the league's premier players, winning the NBA MVP award in 2009 and 2010. After failing to win a championship with Cleveland, James left in 2010 as a free agent to join the Miami Heat; this was announced in the television special The Decision and is among the most controversial free-agent decisions in sports history. James won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in 2012 and 2013; in both of these years, he also earned the league's MVP and Finals MVP awards. After his fourth season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract to re-sign with the Cavaliers. In 2016, he led the Cavaliers to victory over the Golden State Warriors in the Finals by coming back from a 3–1 deficit, delivering the team's first championship and ending the Cleveland sports curse. In 2018, James exercised his contract option to leave the Cavaliers and signed with the Lakers, where he won the 2020 NBA championship and his fourth Finals MVP. James is also the first player in NBA history to accumulate $1 billion in earnings as an active player. Off the court, James has accumulated more wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. He has been featured in books, documentaries (including winning two Sports Emmy Awards as an executive producer), and television commercials. He has won 19 ESPY Awards, hosted Saturday Night Live, and starred in the sports film Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021). James has been a part-owner of Liverpool F.C. since 2011 and leads the LeBron James Family Foundation, which has opened an elementary school, housing complex, retail plaza/community center, and medical center in Akron.","[['is American', 'Lakers'], ['is professional', 'Lakers'], ['is', 'widely considered'], ['is', 'often compared'], ['is often compared to', 'Michael Jordan'], ['is', 'often

163,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Singapore,Singapore,"Singapore (/ˈsɪŋ(ɡ)əpɔːr/), officially the Republic of Singapore, is a sovereign island country and city-state in maritime Southeast Asia. It lies about one degree of latitude (137 kilometres or 85 miles) north of the equator, off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, bordering the Strait of Malacca to the west, the Singapore Strait to the south, the South China Sea to the east, and the Straits of Johor to the north. The country's territory is composed of one main island, 63 satellite islands and islets, and one outlying islet; the combined area of these has increased by 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects. It has the third highest population density in the world. With a multicultural population and recognising the need to respect cultural identities of the major ethnic groups within the nation, Singapore has four official languages: English, Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil. English is the lingua franca and numerous public services are available only in English. Multiracialism is enshrined in the constitution and continues to shape national policies in education, housing, and politics. Singapore's history dates back at least a millennium, having been a maritime emporium known as Temasek and subsequently as a major constituent part of several successive thalassocratic empires. Its contemporary era began in 1819 when Stamford Raffles established Singapore as an entrepôt trading post of the British Empire. In 1867, the colonies in Southeast Asia were reorganised and Singapore came under the direct control of Britain as part of the Straits Settlements. During the Second World War, Singapore was occupied by Japan in 1942, and returned to British control as a separate crown colony following Japan's surrender in 1945. Singapore gained self-governance in 1959 and in 1963 became part of the new federation of Malaysia, alongside Malaya, North Borneo, and Sarawak. Ideological differences, most notably the perceived encroachment of the egalitarian ""Malaysian Malaysia"" political ideology led by Lee Kuan Yew into the other constituent entities of Malaysia—at the perceived expense of the bumiputera and the policies of Ketuanan Melayu—eventually led to Singapore's expulsion from the federation two years later; Singapore became an independent sovereign country in 1965. After early years of turbulence whilst lacking natural resources and a hinterland, the nation rapidly developed to become one of the Four Asian Tigers based on international trade and economic globalisation, integrating itself within the world economy through free trade with minimal-to-no trade barriers or tariffs, export-oriented industrialisation, and the large accumulation of received foreign direct investments, foreign-exchange reserves, and assets held by sovereign wealth funds. A highly developed country, it is tied at 11th on the UN Human Development Index and has the second-highest GDP per capita (PPP) in the world. Identified as a tax haven, Singapore is the only country in Asia with a AAA sovereign credit rating from all major rating agencies. It is a major aviation, financial, and maritime shipping hub, and has consistently been ranked as one of the most expensive cities to live in for expatriates and foreign workers. Singapore is placed highly in key social indicators: education, healthcare, quality of life, personal safety, infrastructure, and housing, with a home-ownership rate of 88 percent. Singaporeans enjoy one of the longest life expectancies, fastest Internet connection speeds, lowest infant mortality rates, and lowest levels of corruption in the world. Singapore is a unitary parliamentary republic with a Westminster system of unicameral parliamentary government, and its legal system is based on common law. Although the country is a multi-party democracy with free elections, the government under the People's Action Party (PAP) wields significant control and dominance over politics and society. The PAP has ruled the country continuously since full internal self-government was achieved in 1959, with 83 out of 104 seats in Parliament as of the 2020 election, the rest of the seats being held by the Workers' Party (WP) and the Progress Singapore Party (PSP). One of the five founding members of ASEAN, Singapore is also the headquarters of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Secretariat, the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) Secretariat, and is the host city of many international conferences and events. Singapore is also a member of the United Nations, World Trade Organization, East Asia Summit, Non-Aligned Movement, and the Commonwealth of Nations.","[['is', 'island country'], ['is', 'sovereign

A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 under President Barack Obama, and represented Delaware in the United States Senate from 1973 to 2009. Biden was born and raised in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and moved with his family to Delaware in 1953 when he was ten years old. He studied at the University of Delaware before earning his law degree from Syracuse University. He was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970 and became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history after he was elected to the United States Senate from Delaware in 1972, at age 29. Biden was the chair or ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for 12 years. He also chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1987 to 1995; led the effort to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act; and oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including the contentious hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. Biden ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008, before becoming Obama's vice president after they won the 2008 presidential election. During his two terms as vice president, Biden frequently represented the administration in negotiations with congressional Republicans and was a close counselor to President Obama. Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, defeated incumbent Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Upon inauguration, he became the oldest president in U.S. history and the first to have a female vice president. Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act to help the U.S. recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recession. He proposed the American Jobs Plan, aspects of which were incorporated into the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. He proposed the American Families Plan, which was merged with other aspects of the American Jobs Plan into the proposed Build Back Better Act. After facing opposition in the Senate, the Build Back Better Act's size was reduced and it was comprehensively reworked into the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, covering deficit reduction, climate change, healthcare, and tax reform. Biden appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. In foreign policy, he restored the U.S. into the Paris Agreement on climate change. He completed the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, during which the Afghan government collapsed and the Taliban seized control. He responded to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorizing foreign aid and weapons shipments to Ukraine.","[['is', 'American who'], ['represented Delaware

166,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/John_Lennon,John Lennon,"John Winston Ono Lennon (born John Winston Lennon; 9 October 1940 – 8 December 1980) was an English singer, songwriter, musician and peace activist who achieved worldwide fame as founder, co-songwriter, co-lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist of the Beatles. Lennon's work was characterised by the rebellious nature and acerbic wit of his music, writing and drawings, on film, and in interviews. His songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney remains the most successful in history. Born in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1956, he formed The Quarrymen, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Sometimes called ""the smart Beatle"", he was initially the group's de facto leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. Lennon soon expanded his work into other media by participating in numerous films, including How I Won the War, and authoring In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works, both collections of nonsense writings and line drawings. Starting with ""All You Need Is Love"", his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture of the 1960s. In 1969, he started the Plastic Ono Band with his second wife, the multimedia artist Yoko Ono, held the two-week-long anti-war demonstration Bed-ins for Peace, and left the Beatles to embark on a solo career. Between 1968 and 1972, Lennon and Ono collaborated on many works, including a trilogy of avant-garde albums, several more films, his solo debut John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band, and the international top 10 singles ""Give Peace a Chance"", ""Instant Karma!"", ""Imagine"" and ""Happy Xmas (War Is Over)"". Moving to New York City in 1971, his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a three-year deportation attempt by the Nixon administration. Lennon and Ono separated from 1973 to 1975, during which time he produced Harry Nilsson's album Pussy Cats. He also had chart-topping collaborations with Elton John (""Whatever Gets You thru the Night"") and David Bowie (""Fame""). Following a five-year hiatus, Lennon returned to music in 1980 with the Ono collaboration Double Fantasy. He was murdered by a Beatles fan, Mark David Chapman, three weeks after the album's release. As a performer, writer or co-writer, Lennon had 25 number-one singles in the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Double Fantasy, his best-selling album, won the 1981 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. In 1982, Lennon won the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In 2002, Lennon was voted eighth in a BBC history poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. Rolling Stone ranked him the fifth-greatest singer and 38th greatest artist of all time. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame (in 1997) and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (twice, as a member of the Beatles in 1988 and as a solo artist in 1994).","[['was', 'English'], ['has', 'work'], ['Born became', 'involved in skiffle craze'], ['became', 'involved'], ['became', 'involved in skiffle craze'], ['Born became as', 'teenager'], ['became as', 'teenager'], ['Born became', 'involved'], ['formed Quarrymen In', '1956'], ['formed', 'Quarrymen'], ['was', ""initially group 's de facto leader""], ['was', ""group 's de facto leader""], ['soon expanded', 'his work'], ['expanded', 'his work'], ['wife', 'multimedia artist'], ['left', 'Beatles'], ['started', 'Plastic Ono Band'], ['started Plastic Ono Band with', 'his second wife'], ['started Plastic Ono Band with', 'multimedia artist'], ['started Plastic Ono Band In', '1969'], ['started Plastic Ono Band with', 'his wife'], ['produced', ""Harry Nilsson 's album Pussy Cats""], ['separated from', '1973 to 1975'], ['had', 'collaborations'], ['also had', 'chart topping collaborations with Elton John'], ['also had', 'chart topping collaborations'], ['also had', 'collaborations with Elton John'], ['had', 'topping collaborations'], ['also had', 'topping collaborations with Elton John'], ['had', 'topping collaborations with Elton John'], ['had', 'chart topping collaborations with Elton John'], ['also had', 'topping collaborations'], ['had', 'chart topping collaborations'], ['also had', 'collaborations'], ['had', 'collaborations with Elton John'], ['returned to', 'music'], ['returned with', 'Ono collaboration Fantasy'], ['returned with', 'Ono collaboration Double Fantasy'], ['returned Following', 'five year hiatus'], ['returned in', '1980'], ['was murdered Mark David Chapman by', 'Beatles fan'], ['had', '25 number'], ['won Brit Award for', 'Contribution'], ['won Brit Award for', 'Contribution to Music'], ['won Brit Award In', '1982'], ['won', 'Brit Award'], ['won Brit Award for', 'Outstanding Contribution to Music'], ['won Brit Award for', 'Outstanding Contribution'], ['was voted eighth In', '2002'], ['was voted In', '2002'], ['was', 'In 2002 voted eighth in BBC history poll of 100 Greatest Britons'], ['was', 'voted eighth in BBC history poll'], ['was', 'In 2002 voted eighth in BBC history poll'], ['was', 'voted eighth in BBC history poll of 100 Greatest Britons'], ['was', 'voted eighth'], ['was', 'voted'], ['was inducted into', 'Songwriters Hall'], ['was', 'inducted'], ['was inducted into', 'Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1997'], ['was inducted into', 'Songwriters Hall of Fame'], ['was inducted into', 'Songwriters Hall in 1997']]","[['type', 'English'], ['has', 'work'], ['participatedIn', 'skiffle_craze'], ['bornAs', 'teenager'], ['formed', 'Quarrymen'], ['type', ""initially_group_'s_de_facto_leader""], ['type', ""group_'s_de_facto_leader""], ['soonExpanded', 'his_work'], ['multimediaArtist', 'multimedia_artist'], ['left', 'Beatles'], ['started', 'Plastic_Ono_Band'], ['diedWith', 'his_second_wife'], ['bandWith', 'multimedia_artist'], ['diedWith', 'his_wife'], ['produced', ""Harry_Nilsson_'s_album_Pussy_Cats""], ['had', 'collaborations'], ['continuedWith', 'collaborations'], ['with', 'Elton_John'], ['had', 'chart'], ['had', 'topping_collaborations'], ['with', 'topping_collaborations'], ['returnedTo', 'music'], ['returnedWith', 'Ono'], ['returnedWith', 'Fantasy'], ['returnedWith', 'Ono_collaboration'], ['returnedWith', 'Double_Fantasy'], ['returnedFollowing', 'five_year_hiatus'], ['murderedBy', 'Beatles_fan'], ['had', '25_number'], ['awardFor', 'Contribution'], ['awardTo', 'Contribution'], ['contributionTo', 'Music'], ['won', 'Brit_Award'], ['awardTo', 'Outstanding_Contribution'], ['awardFor', 'Outstanding_Contribution'], ['winnerOf', 'BBC_history_poll'], ['pollOf', '100_Greatest_Britons'], ['eighthIn', 'BBC_history_poll'], ['inductedInto', 'Songwriters_Hall'], ['academyOf', 'Songwriters_Hall'], ['hallOf', 'Fame']]"
167,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/New_York_City,New York City,"New York, often called New York City or NYC, is the most populous city in the United States. With a 2020 population of 8,804,190 distributed over 300.46 square miles (778.2 km2), New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States, and is more than twice as populous as second-place Los Angeles. New York City lies at the southern tip of New York State, and constitutes the geographical and demographic center of both the Northeast megalopolis and the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban landmass. With over 20.1 million people in its metropolitan statistical area and 23.5 million in its combined statistical area as of 2020, New York is one of the world's most populous megacities, and over 58 million people live within 250 mi (400 km) of the city. New York City is a global cultural, financial, and media center with a significant influence on commerce, health care and life sciences, entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, dining, art, fashion, and sports. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy, an established safe haven for global investors, and is sometimes described as the capital of the world. Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors and extending into the Atlantic Ocean, New York City comprises five boroughs, each of which is coextensive with a respective county of the state of New York. The five boroughs—Brooklyn (Kings County), Queens (Queens County), Manhattan (New York County), the Bronx (Bronx County), and Staten Island (Richmond County)—were created when local governments were consolidated into a single municipal entity in 1898. The city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. New York City is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the United States, the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world as of 2016. As of 2022, the New York metropolitan area is estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product of over $2.1 trillion, ranking it first worldwide. If the New York metropolitan area were a sovereign state, it would have the eighth-largest economy in the world. As of 2022, New York is home to the highest number of billionaires and millionaires of any city and, in 2017, was the wealthiest city in the world. New York City traces its origins to a trading post founded on the southern tip of Manhattan Island by Dutch colonists in approximately 1624. The settlement was named New Amsterdam (Dutch: Nieuw Amsterdam) in 1626 and was chartered as a city in 1653. The city came under English control in 1664 and was renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York. The city was regained by the Dutch in July 1673 and was renamed New Orange for one year and three months; the city has been continuously named New York since November 1674. New York City was the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790, and has been the largest U.S. city since 1790. The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the U.S. by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and is a symbol of the U.S. and its ideals of liberty and peace. In the 21st century, New York City has emerged as a global node of creativity, entrepreneurship, and environmental sustainability, and as a symbol of freedom and cultural diversity. The New York Times has won the most Pulitzer Prizes for journalism and remains the U.S. media's ""newspaper of record"". In 2019, New York City was voted the greatest city in the world per a survey of over 30,000 people from 48 cities worldwide, citing its cultural diversity. Many districts and monuments in New York City are major landmarks, including three of the world's ten most visited tourist attractions in 2013. A record 66.6 million tourists visited New York City in 2019. Times Square is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater District, one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections, and a major center of the world's entertainment industry. Many of the city's landmarks, skyscrapers, and parks are known around the world, as is the city's fast pace, spawning the term New York minute. The Empire State Building has become the global standard of reference to describe the height and length of other structures. New York has been described by multiple sources to be the most photographed city in the world. The Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village, part of the Stonewall National Monument, is considered the historic epicenter of LGBTQ+ culture and the birthplace of the modern gay rights movement. Manhattan's real estate market is among the most expensive in the world. Providing continuous 24/7 service and contributing to the nickname The City That Never Sleeps, the New York City Subway is the largest single-operator rapid transit system worldwide, with 472 passenger rail stations; and Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan is the busiest transportation hub in the Western Hemisphere. The city has over 120 colleges and universities, including Columbia University, New York University, and the City University of New York system, which is the largest urban public university system in the United States. Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City has been called both the world's leading financial center and the most powerful city in the world, and is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. New York City is the headquarters of the global art market, with numerous art galleries and auction houses collectively hosting half of the world’s art auctions.","[['is in', 'United States'], ['is

168,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/English_language,English language,"English is a West Germanic language of the Indo-European language family, with its earliest forms spoken by the inhabitants of early medieval England. It is named after the Angles, one of the ancient Germanic peoples that migrated to the island of Great Britain. English is genealogically West Germanic, closest related to the Low Saxon and Frisian languages; however, its vocabulary is also distinctively influenced by dialects of French (about 29% of modern English words) and Latin (also about 29%), plus some grammar and a small amount of core vocabulary influenced by Old Norse (a North Germanic language). Speakers of English are called Anglophones. The earliest forms of English, collectively known as Old English, evolved from a group of West Germanic (Ingvaeonic) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century and further mutated by Norse-speaking Viking settlers starting in the 8th and 9th centuries. Middle English began in the late 11th century after the Norman conquest of England, when considerable French (especially Old Norman) and Latin-derived vocabulary was incorporated into English over some three hundred years. Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the start of the Great Vowel Shift and the Renaissance trend of borrowing further Latin and Greek words and roots into English, concurrent with the introduction of the printing press to London. This era notably culminated in the King James Bible and plays of William Shakespeare. Modern English grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European dependent-marking pattern, with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order, to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection, and a fairly fixed subject–verb–object word order. Modern English relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of complex tenses, aspect and mood, as well as passive constructions, interrogatives and some negation. Modern English has spread around the world since the 17th century as a consequence of the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States of America. Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries, English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science, navigation and law. English is the most spoken language in the world and the third-most spoken native language in the world, after Standard Chinese and Spanish. It is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language or one of the official languages in 59 sovereign states. There are more people who have learned English as a second language than there are native speakers. As of 2005, it was estimated that there were over 2 billion speakers of English. English is the majority native language in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland (see Anglosphere), and is widely spoken in some areas of the Caribbean, Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. It is a co-official language of the United Nations, the European Union and many other world and regional international organisations. It is the most widely spoken Germanic language, accounting for at least 70% of speakers of this Indo-European branch.","[['is', 'West Germanic language of Indo European language family with its

169,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/United_Kingdom,United Kingdom,"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a country in Europe, off the north-western coast of the continental mainland. It comprises England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The United Kingdom includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands within the British Isles. Northern Ireland shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland; otherwise, the United Kingdom is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, the English Channel, the Celtic Sea and the Irish Sea. The total area of the United Kingdom is 242,495 square kilometres (93,628 sq mi), with an estimated 2020 population of more than 67 million people. The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy. The capital and largest city is London, a global city and financial centre with a metropolitan area population of over 14 million. Other major cities include Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Liverpool and Leeds. Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have their own devolved governments, each with varying powers. The United Kingdom has evolved from a series of annexations, unions and separations of constituent countries over several hundred years. The Treaty of Union between the Kingdom of England (which included Wales, annexed in 1542) and the Kingdom of Scotland in 1707 formed the Kingdom of Great Britain. Its union in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland created the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Most of Ireland seceded from the UK in 1922, leaving the present United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which formally adopted that name in 1927. The UK became the world's first industrialised country and was the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. In the 21st century, the UK retains considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific, technological and political influence. The nearby Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey are not part of the UK, being Crown Dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation. There are also 14 British Overseas Territories, the last remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's landmass and a third of the world's population, and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture and the legal and political systems of many of its former colonies. The United Kingdom has the world's sixth-largest economy by nominal gross domestic product (GDP), and the eighth-largest by purchasing power parity. It has a high-income economy and a very high Human Development Index rating, ranking 18th in the world. It also performs well in international rankings of education, healthcare, life expectancy and human development. It is a recognised nuclear state and is ranked fourth globally in military expenditure. It has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. The United Kingdom is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7, the Group of Ten, the G20, Five Eyes, the United Nations, NATO, AUKUS, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Interpol, and the World Trade Organization (WTO). It was a member state of the European Communities (EC) and its successor, the European Union (EU), from its accession in 1973 until its withdrawal in 2020 following a referendum held in 2016.","[['is

170,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Manchester_City_F.C.,Manchester City F.C.,"Manchester City Football Club are an English football club based in Manchester that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. Founded in 1880 as St. Mark's (West Gorton), they became Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1894. The club's home ground is the Etihad Stadium in east Manchester, to which they moved in 2003, having played at Maine Road since 1923. Manchester City adopted their sky blue home shirts in 1894, in the first season with the current name. Over the course of its history, the club has won eight league titles, six FA Cups, eight League Cups, six FA Community Shields, and one European Cup Winners' Cup, making them the fifth most successful club in English football. The club joined the Football League in 1892, and won their first major honour, the FA Cup, in 1904. Manchester City The club had its first major period of success in the late 1960s and early 1970s, winning the league title, FA Cup, League Cup, and European Cup Winners Cup under the management of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. After losing the 1981 FA Cup Final, Manchester City went through a period of decline, culminating in relegation to the third tier of English football for the only time in their history in 1998. They since regained promotion to the top tier in 2001–02 and have remained a fixture in the Premier League since 2002–03. Manchester City received considerable financial investment both in playing staff and facilities following its takeover by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan through the Abu Dhabi United Group in 2008. This started a new era of unprecedented success, with the club winning the FA Cup in 2011 and the Premier League in 2012, both their first since the 1960s, followed by another league title in 2014. Under the management of Pep Guardiola, Manchester City won the Premier League in 2018, becoming the only team in the competition history to attain 100 points in a single season. In 2018–19, they won four trophies, completing an unprecedented sweep of all domestic titles in England and becoming the first English men's team to win the domestic treble. This was followed by two consecutive Premier League titles in 2020–21 and 2021–22, the third and fourth in the Guardiola era, as well as the club's first-ever Champions League final in 2021, which they lost to Chelsea. Although Manchester City have yet to win a UEFA Champions League title, by the 2022–23 season they had qualified to play in the competition for twelve consecutive seasons and reached the knockout stages for ten consecutive seasons. Furthermore, the club was ranked third in the UEFA coefficient standings at the end of the 2021–22 campaign, reaching its highest ever position. Manchester City topped the Deloitte Football Money League at the end of the 2020–21 season, making it the football club with the highest revenue in the world, approximated at €644.9 million. In 2021, Forbes estimated the club was the sixth most valuable in the world, worth $4 billion. Manchester City are owned by City Football Group Limited, a British-based holding company valued at £3.73 (US$4.8) billion in November 2019.","[['is in', 'based Manchester'], ['became', 'Ardwick

171,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Manchester_United_F.C.,Manchester United F.C.,"Manchester United Football Club, commonly referred to as Man United (often stylised as Man Utd), or simply United, is a professional football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England. The club competes in the Premier League, the top division in the English football league system. Nicknamed the Red Devils, it was founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, but changed its name to Manchester United in 1902. The club moved from Newton Heath to its current stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910. Manchester United have won a record 20 League titles, 12 FA Cups, five League Cups, and a record 21 FA Community Shields. They have won the European Cup/UEFA Champions League three times, and the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, the Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup once each. In 1968, under the management of Matt Busby, 10 years after eight of the club's players were killed in the Munich air disaster, they became the first English club to win the European Cup. Alex Ferguson is the club's longest-serving and most successful manager, winning 38 trophies, including 13 league titles, five FA Cups, and two Champions League titles between 1986 and 2013. In the 1998–99 season, under Ferguson, the club became the first in the history of English football to achieve the European treble of the Premier League, FA Cup, and UEFA Champions League. In winning the UEFA Europa League under José Mourinho in 2016–17, they became one of five clubs to have won the original three main UEFA club competitions (the Champions League, Europa League and Cup Winners' Cup). Manchester United is one of the most widely supported football clubs in the world and has rivalries with Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal and Leeds United. Manchester United was the highest-earning football club in the world for 2016–17, with an annual revenue of €676.3 million, and the world's third most valuable football club in 2019, valued at £3.15 billion ($3.81 billion). After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was taken private in 2005 after a purchase by American businessman Malcolm Glazer valued at almost £800 million, of which over £500 million of borrowed money became the club's debt. From 2012, some shares of the club were listed on the New York Stock Exchange, although the Glazer family retains overall ownership and control of the club.","[['is professional', 'Trafford'], ['Nicknamed', 'Red Devils'], ['have won', 'record 20 League titles'], ['have won European Cup UEFA Champions League at_time', 'three times'], ['became', 'English club'], ['became', 'first English club'], ['became', 'one of five clubs'], ['became', 'one five clubs'], ['has', 'rivalries with Liverpool'], ['has', 'rivalries'], ['was', 'football club with revenue'], ['was', 'football club with annual revenue'], ['was', 'football club'], ['was', 'earning football club in world with annual revenue of'], ['was', 'earning football club with annual revenue of'], ['was', 'earning football club in world with annual revenue'], ['was', 'earning football club with revenue of'], ['was', 'football club in world with revenue'], ['was', 'football club in world'], ['was', 'football club with annual revenue of'], ['was', 'earning football club'], ['was', 'football club in world with annual revenue'], ['was', 'football club in world with revenue of'], ['was', 'earning football club with annual revenue'], ['was', 'earning football club in world with revenue'], ['was', 'earning football club in world'], ['was', 'football club with revenue of'], ['was', 'earning football club with revenue'], ['was', 'earning football club in world with revenue of'], ['was', 'football club in world with annual revenue of']]","[['old', 'Trafford'], ['redDevils', 'Red_Devils'], ['haveWon', 'record_20_League_titles'], ['haveWon', 'three_times'], ['became', 'English_club'], ['became', 'first_English_club'], ['becameOf', 'five_clubs'], ['became', 'one_five_clubs'], ['with', 'rivalries'], ['competesWith', 'Liverpool'], ['has', 'rivalries'], ['with', 'football_club'], ['with', 'revenue'], ['with', 'annual_revenue'], ['type', 'football_club'], ['with', 'world'], ['in', 'football_club'], ['in', 'world'], ['earning', 'football_club']]"
172,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Lionel_Messi,Lionel Messi,"Lionel Andrés Messi (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi]; born 24 June 1987), also known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and captains the Argentina national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record seven Ballon d'Or awards, a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 35 trophies, including 10 La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and four UEFA Champions Leagues. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474), most goals in a La Liga and European league season (50), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (8), and most assists in La Liga (192), a La Liga season (21) and the Copa América (17). He also holds the record for most international goals by a South American male (94). Messi has scored over 785 senior career goals for club and country, and has the most goals by a player for a single club (672). Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain at the age of 13 to join Barcelona, for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times. During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and in 2019 he won a record sixth Ballon d'Or. Out of contract, he signed for Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021. An Argentine international, Messi holds the national record for appearances and is also the country's all-time leading goalscorer. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup in 2006, and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, and the 2015 and 2016 Copa América, winning the Golden Ball in the 2015 edition. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a third-place finish at the 2019 Copa América, and won the 2021 Copa América, while winning the Golden Ball and Golden Boot award for the latter. This achievement would see him receive a record seventh Ballon d'Or in 2021. Messi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2011 and 2012. In February 2020, he was awarded the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, thus becoming the first footballer and the first team sport athlete to win the award. Later that year, Messi became the second footballer (and second team-sport athlete) to surpass $1 billion in career earnings.","[['is', 'Argentine'], ['is', 'professional'], ['has won', ""record seven

173,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Myanmar,Myanmar,"Myanmar, officially the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, also known as Burma (the official name until 1989), is a country in Southeast Asia. It is the largest country by area in Mainland Southeast Asia, and has a population of about 54 million as of 2017. Myanmar is bordered by Bangladesh and India to its northwest, China to its northeast, Laos and Thailand to its east and southeast, and the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal to its south and southwest. The country's capital city is Naypyidaw, and its largest city is Yangon (Rangoon). Early civilisations in the area included the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu city-states in Upper Myanmar and the Mon kingdoms in Lower Myanmar. In the 9th century, the Bamar people entered the upper Irrawaddy valley, and following the establishment of the Pagan Kingdom in the 1050s, the Burmese language, culture, and Theravada Buddhism slowly became dominant in the country. The Pagan Kingdom fell to Mongol invasions, and several warring states emerged. In the 16th century, reunified by the Taungoo dynasty, the country became the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia for a short period. The early 19th-century Konbaung dynasty ruled over an area that included modern Myanmar and briefly controlled Manipur and Assam as well. The British East India Company seized control of the administration of Myanmar after three Anglo-Burmese Wars in the 19th century, and the country became a British colony. After a brief Japanese occupation, Myanmar was reconquered by the Allies and gained independence in 1948. Following a coup d'état in 1962, it became a military dictatorship under the Burma Socialist Programme Party. For most of its independent years, the country has been engulfed in rampant ethnic strife and its myriad ethnic groups have been involved in one of the world's longest-running ongoing civil wars. During this time, the United Nations and several other organisations have reported consistent and systemic human rights violations in the country. In 2011, the military junta was officially dissolved following a 2010 general election, and a nominally civilian government was installed. This, along with the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and political prisoners and successful elections in 2015, improved the country's human rights record and foreign relations and led to the easing of trade and other economic sanctions, although the country's treatment of its ethnic minorities, particularly in connection with the Rohingya conflict, continued to be condemned by international organizations and many nations. Following the 2020 Myanmar general election, in which Aung San Suu Kyi's party won a clear majority in both houses, the Burmese military (Tatmadaw) again seized power in a coup d'état. The coup, which was widely condemned by the international community, led to continuous ongoing widespread protests in Myanmar and has been marked by violent political repression by the military. The military also arrested Aung San Suu Kyi and charged her with crimes ranging from corruption to the violation of COVID-19 protocols, all of which have been labeled as ""politically motivated"" by independent observers, in order to remove her from public life. Myanmar is a member of the East Asia Summit, Non-Aligned Movement, ASEAN, and BIMSTEC, but it is not a member of the Commonwealth of Nations despite once being part of the British Empire. The country is very rich in natural resources, such as jade, gems, oil, natural gas, teak and other minerals, as well as also endowed with renewable energy, having the highest solar power potential compared to other countries of the Great Mekong Subregion. However, Myanmar has long suffered from instability, factional violence, corruption, poor infrastructure, as well as a long history of colonial exploitation with little regard to human development. In 2013, its GDP (nominal) stood at US$56.7 billion and its GDP (PPP) at US$221.5 billion. The income gap in Myanmar is among the widest in the world, as a large proportion of the economy is controlled by cronies of the military junta. As of 2020, according to the Human Development Index, Myanmar ranks 147 out of 189 countries in terms of human development. Since 2021, more than 600,000 people were displaced across Myanmar due to the surge in violence post-coup, with more than 3 million people in dire need of humanitarian assistance.","[['Republic of', 'Union'], ['also known as', 'Burma'], ['known as', 'Burma'], ['is', 'country'], ['is country by', 'area in Mainland Southeast Asia'], ['is country by', 'area'], ['is', 'largest country'], ['is largest country by', 'area'], ['has', 'population'], ['is largest country by', 'area in Mainland Southeast Asia'], ['is bordered by', 'Bangladesh'], ['is', 'bordered by Bangladesh to its northwest'], ['is', 'bordered by Bangladesh to its east'], ['is', 'bordered by Bangladesh to its northwest to its east'], ['is', 'bordered by Bangladesh to its northwest to its northeast'], ['is', 'bordered by Bangladesh to its northeast'], ['is', 'bordered by Bangladesh to its northeast to its east'], ['is', 'bordered by Bangladesh to its northwest to its northeast to its east'], ['was reconquered by', 'Allies'], ['was', 'After Japanese occupation reconquered by Allies'], ['was', 'After occupation reconquered by Allies'], ['gained independence in', '1948'], ['was', 'After brief occupation reconquered by Allies'], ['gained', 'independence'], ['was', 'After brief Japanese occupation reconquered by Allies'], ['became under', 'Burma Socialist Programme Party'], ['became', 'dictatorship'], ['became Following', ""coup d'état in 1962""], ['became Following', ""coup d'état""], ['became', 'military dictatorship'], ['being despite', 'part of British Empire'], ['is member of', 'East Asia Summit'], ['being despite', 'part'], ['is', 'member'], ['However has long suffered from', 'instability'], ['has long suffered from', 'instability'], ['However has suffered from', 'instability'], ['has suffered from', 'instability'], ['ranks', '147']]","[['republicOf', 'Union'], ['knownAs', 'Burma'], ['isIn', 'area'], ['isIn', 'Mainland_Southeast_Asia'], ['isBy', 'area'], ['type', 'largest_country'], ['has', 'population'], ['borderedBy', 'Bangladesh'], ['belongsTo', 'Bangladesh'], ['borderTo', 'its_northwest'], ['bordersTo', 'its_east'], ['bordersTo', 'its_northeast'], ['capturedBy', 'Allies'], ['by', 'Japanese_occupation'], ['by', 'occupation'], ['by', 'brief_occupation'], ['gained', 'independence'], ['by', 'brief_Japanese_occupation'], ['becameUnder', 'Burma_Socialist_Programme_Party'], ['governmentBecame', 'dictatorship'], ['becameFollowing', ""coup_d'état""], ['governmentBecame', 'military_dictatorship'], ['beingOf', 'part'], ['beingOf', 'British_Empire'], ['memberOf', 'East_Asia_Summit'], ['beingDespite', 'part'], ['type', 'member'], ['suffersFrom', 'instability']]"
174,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Paul_McCartney,Paul McCartney,"Sir James Paul McCartney CH MBE (born 18 June 1942) is an English singer, songwriter and musician who gained worldwide fame with the Beatles, for whom he played bass guitar and shared primary songwriting and lead vocal duties with John Lennon. One of the most successful composers and performers of all time, McCartney is known for his melodic approach to bass-playing, versatile and wide tenor vocal range, and musical eclecticism, exploring styles ranging from pre–rock and roll pop to classical and electronica. His songwriting partnership with Lennon remains the most successful in history. Born in Liverpool, McCartney taught himself piano, guitar and songwriting as a teenager, having been influenced by his father, a jazz player, and rock and roll performers such as Little Richard and Buddy Holly. He began his career when he joined Lennon's skiffle group, the Quarrymen, in 1957, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Sometimes called ""the cute Beatle"", McCartney later involved himself with the London avant-garde and spearheaded the incorporation of experimental aesthetics into the Beatles' studio productions. Starting with the 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, he gradually became the band's de facto leader, providing the creative impetus for most of their music and film projects. Many of his Beatles songs, including ""And I Love Her"", ""Yesterday"", ""Eleanor Rigby"", and ""Blackbird"", rank among the most covered songs in history. While primarily a bassist with the Beatles, in various songs he played a number of other instruments, including keyboards, guitars, and drums. After the Beatles disbanded, he debuted as a solo artist with the 1970 album McCartney and formed the band Wings with his first wife, Linda, and Denny Laine. Led by McCartney, Wings was one of the most successful bands of the 1970s, and he wrote or co-wrote their US or UK number-one hits ""My Love"", ""Band on the Run"", ""Listen to What the Man Said"", ""Silly Love Songs"", and ""Mull of Kintyre"". He resumed his solo career in 1980 and has toured as a solo artist since 1989. Without Wings, his UK or US number-one hits have included ""Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey"" (with Linda), ""Coming Up"", ""Pipes of Peace"", ""Ebony and Ivory"" (with Stevie Wonder), and ""Say Say Say"" (with Michael Jackson). Beyond music, he has taken part in projects to promote international charities related to such subjects as animal rights, seal hunting, land mines, vegetarianism, poverty, and music education. McCartney has written or co-written a record 32 songs that have topped the Billboard Hot 100, and, as of 2009, had sales of 25.5 million RIAA-certified units in the US. His honours include two inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (as a member of the Beatles in 1988 and as a solo artist in 1999), an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, 18 Grammy Awards, an appointment as a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1965 and a knighthood in 1997 for services to music. As of 2020, he is one of the wealthiest musicians in the world, with an estimated fortune of £800 million.","[['lead duties with', 'John Lennon'], ['lead', 'duties'], ['played', 'bass guitar'], ['shared', 'primary songwriting'], ['lead', 'vocal duties'], ['shared', 'songwriting'], ['Born taught', 'piano'], ['taught', 'himself'], ['taught', 'piano'], ['Born taught piano as', 'teenager'], ['Born taught', 'himself'], ['taught piano as', 'teenager'], ['joined', ""Lennon 's skiffle group""], ['joined', 'Quarrymen'], ['began', 'his career'], ['providing', 'impetus for most of'], ['providing', 'impetus'], ['providing', 'creative impetus for most of'], ['providing', 'creative impetus for most'], ['Starting gradually became', ""band 's de facto leader""], ['became', ""band 's de facto leader""], ['providing', 'creative impetus'], ['Starting became', ""band 's de facto leader""], ['gradually became', ""band 's de facto leader""], ['providing', 'impetus for most'], ['debuted', 'Beatles disbanded'], ['formed band Wings with', 'his first wife'], ['formed', 'band Wings'], ['debuted', 'After Beatles disbanded'], ['wife', 'Linda'], ['debuted as', 'solo artist'], ['formed band Wings with', 'his wife'], ['formed band Wings with', 'Linda'], ['debuted with', '1970 album McCartney'], ['wrote', 'their US number one'], ['toured since', '1989'], ['resumed', 'his solo career'], ['toured as', 'solo artist'], ['promote', 'charities related to subjects'], ['promote', 'international charities'], ['has taken part in', 'projects'], ['promote', 'charities related to such subjects as animal rights'], ['promote', 'international charities related to subjects'], ['has taken seal hunting Beyond', 'music'], ['has taken seal hunting in', 'projects'], ['promote', 'international charities related to such subjects as animal rights'], ['promote', 'international charities related to such subjects'], ['promote', 'charities related to subjects as animal rights'], ['promote', 'international charities related to subjects as animal rights'], ['promote', 'charities related'], ['promote', 'charities related to such subjects'], ['has taken part Beyond', 'music'], ['promote', 'international charities related'], ['has taken', 'part'], ['has taken', 'seal hunting'], ['promote', 'charities'], ['has written', 'record 32 songs']]","[['with', 'John_Lennon'], ['lead', 'duties'], ['played', 'bass_guitar'], ['shared', 'primary_songwriting'], ['lead', 'vocal_duties'], ['bornTaught', 'piano'], ['taught', 'himself'], ['bornAs', 'teenager'], ['joined', ""Lennon_'s_skiffle_group""], ['joined', 'Quarrymen'], ['began', 'career'], ['providing', 'impetus'], ['providing', 'creative_impetus'], ['laterBecame', ""band_'s_de_facto_leader""], ['groupDisbanded', 'Beatles'], ['diedWith', 'his_first_wife'], ['formed', 'band_Wings'], ['wife', 'Linda'], ['debutedAs', 'solo_artist'], ['performsWith', 'his_wife'], ['recordedWith', 'Linda'], ['debutedWith', '1970_album_McCartney'], ['wrote', 'their_US_number'], ['resumed', 'solo_career'], ['promoteTo', 'charities'], ['refersTo', 'subjects'], ['promote', 'international_charities'], ['participatedIn', 'projects'], ['promoteAs', 'charities'], ['promoteAs', 'such_subjects'], ['promotesAs', 'animal_rights'], ['promoteTo', 'international_charities'], ['huntingBeyond', 'music'], ['promoteAs', 'international_charities'], ['dedicatedTo', 'such_subjects'], ['promoteAs', 'subjects'], ['promote', 'charities'], ['taken', 'part'], ['taken', 'seal_hunting'], ['written', '32_songs']]"
175,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/The_Matrix,The Matrix,"The Matrix is a 1999 science fiction action film written and directed by the Wachowskis. It is the first installment in The Matrix film series, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano, and depicts a dystopian future in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside the Matrix, a simulated reality that intelligent machines have created to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source. When computer programmer Thomas Anderson, under the hacker alias ""Neo"", uncovers the truth, he joins a rebellion against the machines along with other people who have been freed from the Matrix. The Matrix is an example of the cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction. The Wachowskis' approach to action scenes was influenced by Japanese animation and martial arts films, and the film's use of fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema influenced subsequent Hollywood action film productions. The film popularized a visual effect known as ""bullet time"", in which the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed, allowing the sped-up movements of certain characters to be perceived normally. The Matrix opened in theaters in the United States on March 31, 1999, to widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its innovative visual effects, action sequences, cinematography and entertainment value, and was a massive success at the box office, grossing over $460 million on a $63 million budget, becoming the highest-grossing Warner Bros. film of 1999 and the fourth highest-grossing film of that year. At the 72nd Academy Awards, the film won all four categories it was nominated for, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Sound, and Best Sound Editing. The film was also the recipient of numerous other accolades, including Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects at the 53rd British Academy Film Awards, and the Wachowskis were awarded Best Director and Best Science Fiction Film at the 26th Saturn Awards. The film is considered to be among the greatest science fiction films of all time, and in 2012, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being ""culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant."" The film's success led to two feature film sequels being released in 2003, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, which were also written and directed by the Wachowskis. The Matrix franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games and animated short films, with which the Wachowskis were heavily involved. The franchise has also inspired books and theories expanding on some of the religious and philosophical ideas alluded to in the films. A fourth film, titled The Matrix Resurrections, was released on December 22, 2021.","[['is', '1999 science fiction action film'], ['is', '1999 science fiction action film written'], ['is', '1999 science fiction action film written by Wachowskis'], ['is', 'first installment'], ['is first installment in', 'Matrix film series'], ['is', 'installment'], ['is installment in', 'Matrix film series'], ['joins', 'rebellion'], ['joins rebellion along', 'other people'], ['joins rebellion along', 'people'], ['joins', 'rebellion against machines'], ['is example of', 'cyberpunk subgenre'], ['is example of', 'cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction'], ['is', 'example'], ['opened to', 'widespread acclaim from critics'], ['opened to', 'widespread acclaim'], ['opened in', 'theaters'], ['opened on', 'March 31 1999'], ['opened to', 'acclaim'], ['opened to', 'acclaim from critics'], ['opened in', 'theaters in United States'], ['was', 'nominated'], ['was nominated for', 'Best Effects'], ['was nominated for', 'Effects'], ['was nominated for', 'Visual Effects'], ['was nominated for', 'Best Visual Effects']]","[['type', '1999_science_fiction_action_film'], ['inspiredBy', '1999_science_fiction_action_film'], ['writtenBy', 'Wachowskis'], ['type', 'first_installment'], ['isIn', 'Matrix_film_series'], ['joins', 'rebellion'], ['rebelsAlong', 'other_people'], ['rebelsAlong', 'people'], ['joinsAgainst', 'rebellion'], ['rebellionAgainst', 'machines'], ['exampleOf', 'cyberpunk_subgenre'], ['isOf', 'science_fiction'], ['type', 'example'], ['openedFrom', 'widespread_acclaim'], ['receivedFrom', 'critics'], ['openedTo', 'widespread_acclaim'], ['openedIn', 'theaters'], ['closedOn', 'March'], ['opened', 'acclaim'], ['releasedFrom', 'acclaim'], ['releasedIn', 'United_States'], ['wonFor', 'Best_Effects'], ['wonFor', 'Effects'], ['wonFor', 'Visual_Effects'], ['wonFor', 'Best_Visual_Effects']]"
176,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Neymar,Neymar,"Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior (born 5 February 1992), known as Neymar, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and the Brazil national team. A prolific goalscorer and renowned playmaker, he is regarded as one of the best players in the world. Neymar has scored at least 100 goals for three different clubs, making him one of three players to achieve this. Neymar came into prominence at Santos, where he made his professional debut aged 17. He helped the club win two successive Campeonato Paulista championships, a Copa do Brasil, and the 2011 Copa Libertadores; the latter being Santos' first since 1963. Neymar was twice named the South American Footballer of the Year, in 2011 and 2012, and soon relocated to Europe to join Barcelona. As part of Barcelona's attacking trio with Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez, dubbed MSN, he won the continental treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League. He then attained a domestic double in the 2015–16 season. Motivated to be a talisman at club level, Neymar transferred to PSG in 2017 in a move worth €222 million, making him the most expensive player ever. In France, he won four league titles, among other honours, and was voted Ligue 1 Player of the Year in his debut season. Notably, he helped PSG attain a domestic quadruple in the 2019–20 season, and led the club to its first ever Champions League Final. With 76 goals in 123 matches for Brazil since debuting at age 18, Neymar is the second highest goalscorer for his national team, trailing Pelé. At his youth stage for Brazil, he was a key player in the victory at the 2011 South American Youth Championship, where he finished as leading goalscorer, and also attained a silver medal in men's football at the 2012 Summer Olympics. The following year, he won the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, winning the Golden Ball. His participation in the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2015 Copa América was cut short by injury and a suspension, respectively, before captaining Brazil to their first Olympic gold medal in men's football at the 2016 Summer Olympics. Having renounced the captaincy, he featured at the 2018 World Cup, and after missing the 2019 Copa América through injury, helped Brazil to a runner-up finish at the 2021 tournament. Neymar finished third for the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2015 and 2017, has been awarded the FIFA Puskás Award, has been named in the FIFA FIFPro World11 twice, the UEFA Team of the Year twice, and the UEFA Champions League Squad of the Season three times. Off the pitch, he ranks among the world's most prominent sportsmen. SportsPro named him the most marketable athlete in the world in 2012 and 2013, and ESPN cited him as the world's fourth-most famous athlete in 2016. In 2017, Time included him in its annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world. In 2018, France Football ranked Neymar the world's third highest-paid footballer. The following year, Forbes ranked him the world's third highest-paid athlete, dropping a spot to fourth in 2020.","[['is', 'professional footballer'], ['is Brazilian professional footballer', 'plays

178,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/United_States,United States,"The United States of America (U.S.A. or USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S. or US) or informally America, is the most populous country in North America. It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major unincorporated territories, nine Minor Outlying Islands, and 326 Indian reservations. It is the third-largest country by both land and total area. The United States shares land borders with Canada to its north and with Mexico to its south. It has maritime borders with the Bahamas, Cuba, Russia, and other nations. With a population of over 331 million, it is the third most populous country in the world. The national capital is Washington, D.C., and the most populous city and financial center is New York City. Paleo-aboriginals migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago, and advanced cultures began to appear later on. These advanced cultures had almost completely declined by the time the Europeans had arrived in North America, who subsequently began to colonize the continent. The United States emerged from the Thirteen British Colonies when disputes with the British Crown over taxation and political representation led to the American Revolution (1765–1784), which established the nation's independence. In the late 18th century, the U.S. began expanding across North America, gradually obtaining new territories, sometimes through war, frequently displacing Native Americans, and admitting new states. By 1848, the United States spanned the continent from east to west. The controversy surrounding the practice of slavery culminated in the secession of the Confederate States of America, which fought the remaining states of the Union during the American Civil War (1861–1865). With the Union's victory and preservation, slavery was abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment. By 1900, the United States had become the world's largest economy, and the Spanish–American War and World War I established the country as a world power. After Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the U.S. entered World War II on the Allied side. The aftermath of the war left the United States and the Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers. During the Cold War, both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological dominance but avoided direct military conflict. They also competed in the Space Race, which culminated in the 1969 American spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon. Simultaneously, the civil rights movement led to legislation abolishing state and local Jim Crow laws and other codified racial discrimination against African Americans. The Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991 ended the Cold War, leaving the United States as the world's sole superpower. The September 11 attacks in 2001 resulted in the United States launching the war on terror which included the War in Afghanistan (2001–2021) and the Iraq War (2003–2011). The United States is a federal republic with three separate branches of government, including a bicameral legislature. It is a liberal democracy and market economy; it ranks high in international measures of human rights, quality of life, income and wealth, economic competitiveness, and education; and it has low levels of perceived corruption. It has high levels of incarceration and inequality, allows capital punishment, and lacks universal health care. As a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities, the U.S. has been shaped by centuries of immigration. The United States is a highly developed country, and its economy accounts for approximately a quarter of global GDP and is the world's largest by GDP at market exchange rates. By value, the United States is the world's largest importer and second-largest exporter. Although it accounts for just over 4.2% of the world's total population, the U.S. holds over 30% of the total wealth in the world, the largest share held by any country. The United States is a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Organization of American States, NATO, and is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The country makes up more than a third of global military spending and is the foremost military power in the world and a leading political, cultural, and scientific force.","[['is', 'populous

179,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Nancy_Pelosi,Nancy Pelosi,"Nancy Patricia Pelosi (/pəˈloʊsi/; née D'Alesandro; born March 26, 1940) is an American politician who has served as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives since 2019 and previously from 2007 to 2011. She has represented California's 12th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives since 1987. The district, numbered as the 5th district from 1987 to 1993 and the 8th from 1993 to 2013, includes most of the city of San Francisco. A member of the Democratic Party, Pelosi is the first woman elected Speaker and the first woman to lead a major political party in either chamber of Congress. Pelosi was born and raised in Baltimore, the daughter of mayor and congressman Thomas D'Alesandro. She graduated from Trinity College, Washington in 1962 and married businessman Paul Pelosi the next year; the two had met while both were students. They moved to New York City before settling down in San Francisco with their children. Focused on raising her family, Pelosi stepped into politics as a volunteer for the Democratic Party. She was first elected to Congress in a 1987 special election and is now in her 18th term; she is the dean of California's congressional delegation. Pelosi steadily rose through the ranks of the House Democratic Caucus to be elected House minority whip in 2002 and elevated to House minority leader a year later, becoming the first woman to hold each of those positions in either chamber of Congress. Under her leadership, Democrats gained a majority in the House for the first time in 12 years during the 2006 midterm elections; thereafter, Pelosi was elected Speaker of the House, becoming the first woman to hold that office. During her first speakership, Pelosi was a major opponent of the Iraq War as well as the Bush administration's attempts to partially privatize Social Security. She participated in the passage of the Obama administration's landmark bills, including the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and the 2010 Tax Relief Act. Pelosi lost the speakership after the Republican Party retook the majority in the 2010 midterm elections, but she retained her role as leader of the House Democrats and became House minority leader for the second time. After the 2018 midterm elections, Democrats regained control of the House, and Pelosi was again elected Speaker, becoming the first former speaker to reclaim the gavel since Sam Rayburn in 1955. During her second speakership, the House twice impeached President Donald Trump, first in December 2019 and again in January 2021; the Senate acquitted Trump both times. She participated in the passage of the Biden administration's landmark bills, including the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. In the 2022 midterm elections, Republicans regained control of the House, thus ending her second speakership. She announced her retirement as the leader of the House Democratic Caucus shortly thereafter, but said she would remain a member of the House. On November 29, 2022, the House Democratic Caucus appointed Pelosi Speaker Emerita of the United States House of Representatives.","[['is', 'American'], ['has represented', ""California 's district in

Early inhabitants were known as the Andhras, tracing their history back to the Vedic period, when they were mentioned in the 8th century BCE Rigvedic text Aitareya Brahmana. According to the Aitareya Brahmana, the Andhras left North India from the banks of the Yamuna river and migrated to South India. The Assaka Mahajanapada (700–300 BCE) was an ancient kingdom located between the Godavari and Krishna rivers in southeastern India. Accounts that people in the region are descended from the Viswamitra are found in the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Puranas. The region also derives its name from the Satavahanas, who are also known as Andhras, the earliest kings of Andhra Pradesh and India. People of the said era supported local art and culture by building temples and sculptures of the Buddhist monuments in the state. It was ruled by the Mauryan Empire, Satavahana dynasty, Salankayanas, Andhra Ikshvakus, Pallavas, Vishnukundinas, Eastern Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Cholas, Kakatiyas, Vijayanagara Empire, Gajapati Empire, Mughal Empire, Deccan sultanates, Qutb Shahi dynasty, and Asaf Jahis. In the 3rd century BCE, Andhra was a vassal kingdom of Ashoka, but after his death Andhra became powerful and extended its empire to the whole of Maratha country and beyond. Andhra Pradesh comprises three major regions namely Rayalaseema in the south-west, Coastal Andhra bordering the Bay of Bengal in the east and Uttarandhra at north-east. The state has 26 districts, 6 in Uttarandhra, 12 in Coastal Andhra and 8 in Rayalaseema. The state also borders a union territory, Yanam – a district of Puducherry, which lies to the south of Kakinada in the Godavari delta on the eastern side of the state. The economy of Andhra Pradesh is the 8th largest in India, with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of ₹8.84 trillion (US$110 billion) and has the country's 17th-highest GSDP per capita of ₹170,000 (US$2,100). Andhra Pradesh ranks 27th among Indian states in Human Development Index (HDI). It has a jurisdiction over almost 15,000 square kilometres (5,800 sq mi) of territorial waters. Andhra Pradesh hosted 121.8 million visitors in 2015, a 30% growth in tourist arrivals over the previous year, making it the third most-visited state in India. The Tirumala Venkateswara Temple in Tirupati is one of the world's most visited religious sites, with 18.25 million visitors per year. The region is also home to a variety of other pilgrimage centres, such as the Pancharama Kshetras, Mallikarjuna Jyotirlinga and Kodanda Rama Temple. The state's natural attractions include the beaches of Visakhapatnam, hill stations such as the Araku Valley and Horsley Hills, and the deltas of Konaseema in the Godavari river, and Diviseema in the Krishna river.","[['is', 'state'], ['is state in', 'south eastern coastal region of India'], ['is state in', 'coastal region of India'], ['is state in', 'south eastern region'], ['is state in', 'south

181,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Maharashtra,Maharashtra,"Maharashtra (/məhɑːˈrɑːʃtrə/; Marathi: [məharaːʂʈɾə], abbr. MH or Maha) is a state in the western peninsular region of India occupying a substantial portion of the Deccan Plateau. Maharashtra is the second-most populous state in India and the second-most populous country subdivision globally. It was formed on 1 May 1960 by splitting the bilingual Bombay State, which had existed since 1956, into majority Marathi-speaking Maharashtra and Gujarati-speaking Gujarat. Maharashtra is home to the Marathi people, the predominant ethno-linguistic group, who speak the Marathi language, the official language of the state. The state is divided into 6 divisions and 36 districts, with the state capital being Mumbai, the most populous urban area in India, and Nagpur serving as the winter capital, which also hosts the winter session of the state legislature. Godavari and Krishna are the two major rivers in the state. Forests cover 16.47 per cent of the state's geographical area. Out of the total cultivable land in the state, about 60 per cent is used for grain crops in the Deccan region, rice in coastal Konkan, and other high rainfall areas. Spread over 307,713 km2 (118,809 sq mi), Maharashtra is the third-largest state by area in India. It is bordered by the Arabian Sea to the west, the Indian states of Karnataka and Goa to the south, Telangana to the southeast and Chhattisgarh to the east, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh to the north, and the Indian union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu to the northwest. The state has three international airports, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (Mumbai), Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar International Airport (Nagpur), and Pune Airport. The state is home to three railways headquarters viz. Central Railway (Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus), Konkan Railway (CBD Belapur), and Western Railway (Churchgate). The High Court of the state viz. Bombay High Court is located in Mumbai. The state contributes 48 seats and 19 seats to the lower house Lok Sabha and the upper house Rajya Sabha, respectively. Maharashtra has been subject to President's rule three times since its formation for a total of 156 days for different reasons. More than three-fourths of the population practice Hinduism, which is followed by Islam and Buddhism. The state is home to four UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Ajanta, Ellora and Elephanta caves, and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (formerly Victoria Terminus). Maharashtra is one of the most industrialised states in India. The state's capital, Mumbai, is India's financial and commercial capital. India's largest stock exchange Bombay Stock Exchange, the oldest in Asia, is located in the city, as is National Stock Exchange, which is second largest stock echange in India and one of world’s largest derivatives exchanges. The state has played a significant role in the country's social and political life and is widely considered a leader in terms of agricultural and industrial production, trade and transport, and education. Maharashtra is among the most developed Indian states and continues to be the single largest contributor to the national economy with a share of 14 per cent in all-India nominal GDP. The economy of Maharashtra is the largest in India, with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of ₹35.81 trillion (US$450 billion) and GSDP per capita of ₹225,073 (US$2,800). The service sector dominates the state's economy, accounting for 69.3 per cent of the value of the output of the country. Although agriculture accounts for 12 per cent of the state GDP, it employs nearly half the population of the state. Maharashtra is the fifteenth-highest ranking among Indian states in the human development index. The region that encompasses the state has a history going back many millennia. Prior to Indian independence, notable dynasties and entities that ruled the region include in a chronological order, the Asmakas, the Mauryas, the Satavahanas, the Western Satraps, the Abhiras, the Vakatakas, the Chalukyas, the Rashtrakutas, the Western Chalukyas, the Seuna Yadavas, the Khaljis, the Tughlaqs, the Bahamanis, the Deccan sultanates, the Mughals, the Maratha Empire founded by Shivaji, and the British. Ruins, monuments, tombs, forts, and places of worship left by these rulers are dotted around the state. At the time of the Indian independence movement in the early 20th century, along with British ruled areas of Bombay presidency, and Central Provinces and Berar, the region included many British Vassal states. Among these, the erstwhile Hyderabad state was the largest and extended over many modern Indian states. Other states grouped under Deccan States Agency included Kolhapur, Miraj, Sangli, Aundh, Bhor, and Sawantwadi.","[['is state in', 'western region'], ['is', 'state in region'], ['is state in', 'western

183,http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Uttar_Pradesh,Uttar Pradesh,"Uttar Pradesh (/ˌʊtər prəˈdɛʃ/; Hindi: [ˈʊtːəɾ pɾəˈdeː ʃ], lit. 'Northern Province') is a state in northern India. With over 200 million inhabitants, it is the most populated state in India as well as the most populous country subdivision in the world. It was established in 1950 after India had become a republic. It was a successor to the United Provinces (UP) during the period of the Dominion of India (1947–1950), which in turn was a successor to the United Provinces (UP) established in 1935, and eventually of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh established in 1902 during the British Raj. The state is divided into 18 divisions and 75 districts, with the state capital being Lucknow, and Prayagraj serving as the judicial capital. On 9 November 2000, a new state, Uttaranchal (now Uttarakhand), was created from Uttar Pradesh's western Himalayan hill region. The two major rivers of the state, the Ganges and its tributary Yamuna, meet at the Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj, a Hindu pilgrimage site. Other notable rivers are Gomti and Saryu. The forest cover in the state is 6.1 per cent of the state's geographical area. The cultivable area is 82 per cent of total geographical area and net area sown is 68.5 per cent of cultivable area. The state is bordered by Rajasthan to the west, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi to the northwest, Uttarakhand and an international border with Nepal to the north, Bihar to the east, Madhya Pradesh to the south, and touches the states of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh to the southeast. It covers 240,928 km2 (93,023 sq mi), equal to 7.3% of the total area of India, and is the fourth-largest Indian state by area. Though long known for sugar production, the state's economy is now dominated by the services industry. The service sector comprises travel and tourism, hotel industry, real estate, insurance and financial consultancies. The economy of Uttar Pradesh is the third-largest state economy in India with ₹17.05 lakh crore (US$210 billion) in gross domestic product and a per capita GSDP of ₹65,431 (US$820). President's rule has been imposed in Uttar Pradesh ten times since 1968, for different reasons and for a total of 1,700 days. The state has currently three international airports, Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport (Lucknow), Lal Bahadur Shastri Airport (Varanasi) and Kushinagar International Airport (Kushinagar).

The High Court of the state is located in Allahabad. The state contributes 80 seats and 31 seats to the lower house Lok Sabha and the upper house Rajya Sabha, respectively. Inhabitants of the state are called either Awadhi, Bagheli, Bhojpuri, Braji, Bundeli, Kannauji, or Rohilkhandi depending upon their region of origin. Hinduism is practised by more than three-fourths of the population, with Islam being the next largest religious group. Hindi is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state, along with Urdu. Bhojpuri is the second most widely spoken language of the state after Hindi. Uttar Pradesh was home to most of the mainstream political entities that have existed in ancient and medieval India including the Maurya Empire, Harsha Empire, Gupta Empire, Pala Empire, Delhi Sultanate, Mughal Empire as well as many other empires. At the time of Indian independence movement in the early 20th century, there were three major princely states in Uttar Pradesh – Ramgadi, Rampur and Benares. The state houses several holy Hindu temples and pilgrimage centres. Uttar Pradesh has three World Heritage sites and ranks first among tourist destinations in India. Uttar Pradesh has several historical, natural, and religious tourist destinations, including Agra, Aligarh, Ayodhya, Kushinagar, Prayagraj, Varanasi and Vrindavan.","[['is state in', 'India'], ['is state in', 'northern India'], ['is', 'state'], ['is', 'most populated state'], ['is state in', 'India'], ['is', 'With over 200 million inhabitants most populated state in India'], ['is', 'state'], ['is', 'populated state'], ['is populated state With', 'over 200 million inhabitants'], ['is', 'With over 200 million inhabitants populated state in India'], ['is most populated state With', 'over 200 million inhabitants'], ['is state With', 'over 200 million inhabitants'], ['is', 'With over 200 million inhabitants state in India'], ['is most populated state in', 'India'], ['is populated state in', 'India'], ['was established', 'after India had become'], ['was', 'established'], ['was established in', '1950'], ['was established', 'India had become'], ['was', 'successor'], ['was', 'successor to United Provinces during period of Dominion of India'], ['was successor during', 'period of Dominion'], ['was', 'successor to United Provinces during period'], ['was', 'successor to United Provinces during period of Dominion'], ['was successor during', 'period'], ['was successor during', 'period of Dominion of India'], ['was successor to', 'United Provinces'], ['from', 'western Himalayan hill region'], ['covers', '240,928 km2'], ['is', 'state'], ['covers', '240,928 km2 equal to 7.3 % of area of India'], ['covers', '93,023 mi'], ['is', 'fourth state'], ['covers', '93,023 sq mi'], ['covers', '240,928 km2 equal to 7.3 % of area'], ['is fourth state by', 'area'], ['is Indian state by', 'area'], ['covers', '240,928 km2 equal'], ['is state by', 'area'], ['covers', '240,928 km2 equal to 7.3 %'], ['covers', '240,928 km2 equal to 7.3 % of total area'], ['is', 'Indian state'], ['covers', '240,928 km2 equal to 7.3 % of total area of India'], ['is', 'fourth Indian state'], ['is fourth Indian state by', 'area'], ['was home to', 'most'], ['was home to', 'most of mainstream political entities'], ['was home to', 'most of mainstream entities'], ['was home to', 'most of political entities'], ['was home to', 'most of entities'], ['was', 'home'], ['was home to', 'most of political entities including Maurya Empire'], ['was home to', 'most of entities including Maurya Empire'], ['was home to', 'most of mainstream entities including Maurya Empire'], ['was home to', 'most of mainstream political entities including Maurya Empire'], ['ranks among', 'tourist destinations in India'], ['ranks first among', 'tourist destinations'], ['ranks first among', 'tourist destinations in India'], ['has', 'three World Heritage sites'], ['ranks among', 'tourist destinations'], ['has', 'tourist destinations'], ['has', 'several historical tourist destinations'], ['has', 'tourist destinations including Agra'], ['has', 'several tourist destinations'], ['has', 'historical tourist destinations'], ['has', 'several historical tourist destinations including Agra'], ['has', 'historical tourist destinations including Agra'], ['has', 'several tourist destinations including Agra']]","[['stateIn', 'India'], ['isIn', 'northern_India'], ['type', 'state'], ['type', 'most_populated_state'], ['in', 'over_200_million_inhabitants'], ['isIn', 'most_populated_state'], ['type', 'populated_state'], ['isWith', 'over_200_million_inhabitants'], ['isIn', 'over_200_million_inhabitants_state'], ['hadBecome', 'India'], ['type', 'successor'], ['nameOf', 'successor'], ['partOf', 'United_Provinces'], ['datesOf', 'period'], ['partOf', 'Dominion'], ['stateOf', 'India'], ['stateDuring', 'successor'], ['wonDuring', 'United_Provinces'], ['wonDuring', 'period'], ['successorTo', 'United_Provinces'], ['stateFrom', 'western_Himalayan_hill_region'], ['stateCovers', '240,928_km2'], ['coversOf', '240,928_km2'], ['consistsOf', '7.3_%'], ['mapOf', 'area'], ['type', 'fourth_state'], ['stateCovers', '93,023_sq_mi'], ['stateBy', 'area'], ['coversTo', '240,928_km2'], ['equalTo', '7.3_%'], ['outOf', 'total_area'], ['type', 'Indian_state'], ['type', 'fourth_Indian_state'], ['mostOf', 'mainstream_political_entities'], ['mostOf', 'mainstream_entities'], ['listOf', 'political_entities'], ['listOf', 'entities'], ['type', 'home'], ['including', 'political_entities'], ['including', 'Maurya_Empire'], ['including', 'entities'], ['including', 'mainstream_entities'], ['including', 'mainstream_political_entities'], ['ranksIn', 'tourist_destinations'], ['secondAmong', 'tourist_destinations'], ['has', 'three_World_Heritage_sites'], ['has', 'tourist_destinations'], ['has', 'several_historical_tourist_destinations'], ['including', 'tourist_destinations'], ['including', 'Agra'], ['has', 'several_tourist_destinations'], ['has', 'historical_tourist_destinations'], ['including', 'several_historical_tourist_destinations'], ['including', 'historical_tourist_destinations'], ['including', 'several_tourist_destinations']]"
